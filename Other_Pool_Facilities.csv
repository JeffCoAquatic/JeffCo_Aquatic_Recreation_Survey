Also, perhaps a membership option for more ongoing revenue.  I probably have a million more ideas."

I would very likely use an outdoor pool and/or hot tub. If swimming instruction was available outside I would do that. If water exercise was available outside I would use that.  I am a nonbinary transgender man. I have been mercilessly harassed in shared changing/shower facilities all my life pre transition.  I have avoided pools most of my life due to harassment and I barely learned to swim although I love the water. I have never used single gender or shared shower/changing facilities post transition.  unless there are single stall showers and changing rooms, both with full curtains, that are expressly gender nonspecific (all sex/genders), then I would not be using the showers or changing facilities. That would greatly reduce the likelihood of me ever using the pool. On the other hand, if such facilities were available to me, and the pool itself was outdoors, I would envisage pretty frequent use.   I believe a pool is essential for our community. I would love a facility I felt comfortable using.  But I strongly believe we need one even if I were never to use it.    However I cannot support funding that uses a sales tax. This is a very regressive type of tax that puts too great a burden on people with less economic means. It takes a much higher percentage a poor person’s available funds than it does a richer person’s. It also tends to hit harder on  people who do not have the ability to go out of county to do their shopping. I believe it will also be keenly felt by anyone undertaking a major building project here.  The result will be an even greater tendency to purchase materials out of county, for example at big box building suppliers, and that will not be good for our local businesses.    I would also imagine that the sales tax would be applied to services purchased here? Would there be an added tax for dental work? For window washing and roof cleaning or repair? Again, I believe people will increasingly use out of county providers for services and this will not benefit the community.  Please find a less regressive funding mechanism.   I understand that one of the goals of the facility is for use by the public schools. And indeed the new proposed location is to be near a public school.  It seems to me that if the schools are to be using the facility then the school system should be expected to fund some part of it that is equivalent to the anticipated percent of use.  I used to live right next to a school that had a pool that was open to the public during certain hours. I used it once and then never used it. My experience was that the public hours were very short creating a massive competition for space and time. There were so many faster swimmers who were very impatient with beginners like myself.   in the afternoons the schedule was extremely crowded with school-related events, and open swimming ended up being late in the day. Too late and again too crowded.    I fear that having a pool be literally on site of a school will create these kinds of scheduling pressures. And if it is to be used much of the time or half of the time by the schools, then school funding should contribute to paying for it.  I will also weigh in to say that while I appreciate the challenges of building.a new pool on the site of the old pool, a facility in Chimacum will not provide the same level of access to the aging population inhabiting Port Townsend. My observation is that many elderly users currently walk to the pool, and a number of somewhat younger users bike to it.  t. Your survey does not ask about how people would get to the pool.  A number of us elderly folk in the area mask and rarely use public transport because other riders don’t mask. And a number of us are not really comfortable driving long distances.  Biking in this county outside of the city of PT is like handing your life over to a crazy game of a Russian roulette.  My point is that moving the pool out of the City of PT really changes/reduces access for an aging population that would greatly benefit from pool use and from the ability to walk or bike there.    I do not live in the City of PT but I would be way more likely to use a pool located there than in Chimacum: From my perspective it would be a lot better if the pool were located somewhere closer to halfway between.  However, I am under the impression that that ship has sailed And that the site has  pretty much been selected.  I don’t love it. I’ll use the pool less if at all. But I support the pool."
