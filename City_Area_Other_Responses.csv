The demand will grow exponentially over time. We use Shore pool in Port Angeles which is a fabulous lap/ swimmers/ activities pool and it can get easily overcrowded. The pool becomes such a center of community for those who live in Port Angeles, west end, and Sequim. Such a healthy outlet for the young folks as well. The pool operates in the black $$ and they are able to keep it affordable. Conversely, the YMCA in Sequim is expensive and caters more to older folks who are not lap swimmers. Lots of water aerobics and group activities that take over the lap lanes limiting lap swim. So important to have a separate activities pool / area so that the lap lanes are available all day. The pool and sauna are such important therapy spots for veterans who suffer from an assortment of mental health and physical health issues. I am one of those veterans and fully understand the benefits. Make sure the sauna is large enough. The Shore pool sauna is shoulder to shoulder in the evenings when folks are off of work. The sauna gets busy in the mornings as well after early morning lap swim and the aerobics sessions are finished.Spend some time and talk with Steve, the board president, or Mike, the daily pool maintenance guy about what improvements they would make. Think big and think of the future growth of our community and its future needs. The people will definitely come to use the facility especially once they experience its benefits and view it as one of the centers of community. Thanks, Tim Walls, Sequim."

I would love to see  elements appropriate for little children. They also had a ""river"" of water that people could walk or swim through. That was fun. My grandson would visit to go to the pool here with us. I used to visit the pool in Sequim where I enjoyed the hot tub area. It was social and very nice for relieving body aches and such. Even though I most likely would not personally use elements in a facility designed for teens I would love to see those things. I'm not sure what they love these days, but perhaps a game room might be nice for them with foosball, pool, chess, checkers, etc. Exercise equipment could be included in the teen area or in a separate space. Entering a pool can be hard on old legs. It would be nice to have some stair entrances to some of the swim areas. I LOVE the idea of indoor pickleball."
