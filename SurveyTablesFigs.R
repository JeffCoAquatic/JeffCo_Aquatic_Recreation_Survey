# General notes - choose color-blind friendly palette, inlcude number of response stats for each question

# tabulate the number of people by geo area relative to census data - how far off the mark?


#Tables and Figures To-Do List:

### 1.) Summary of responses/what's presented: Include table w/residency status. Total # submissions (include completes and partials), removed non-resident/visitor (include #) surveys for this purpose

          # - include table of residents by location and add column with 2020 census data by location
          # - reassign 'other' category (delete non-Jeffco, keep unassigned as 'other')
### 4.) What is your age?
        # - re-do as bar plot (percentage - scale to 100)
        # - table of column sums across age groups, county-wide - include data on age distribution from census data
        # require some manual review/edits - adjust non-numeric entries
### 5.) how important is it to you to have an aquatic facility?
        # - barplot (percentages) w/table (numbers and percentages)

### 8.) which ones did you use?

### 9.) how often do you use an aquatic facility?
      # - keep as pie chart w/custom color palette and percentages on chart
### 10.) aquatic amenities
      # - keep as bar chart, reverse order overall
      # - produce age-based figures as well, may not use in presentation
      # - select top 5 per age group
      # - work on a way to bin household ages (mean household age) - if we have time??
### 11.) Non aquatic - exactly the same as above
### 12.) How much more would you use an aquatic facility, if amenities?
      # include pie chart 
      # also include chart with comparison to current useage (bar chart with two colors to show before and after)
### 13.) non-aquatic amenities
      # include pie chart
      # include before and after chart as well?
      # what the survey does and doesn't show here

      # bar chart by geographic area 
      # bar chart by person responding to represent voting status?

### are there other categories that matter and/or other ways to weight the data?
