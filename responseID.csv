rAEB9c7P,Yay!
1KDTGMhx,"I feel that improved aquatic programming is essential for promoting water safety, while also supporting community wellness. We need more healthy indoor activities in this community!"
YwDTzgNp,Please abandon this boondoggle.  The county can't manage its existing facilities.  If this ever were to be successful a private entity would need to do it.
NhkQld3v,Hadlock
aifBM6kn,Let Hadlock residents pay for a pool and maintenance of it if they want one .
ehEBUKfq,"To succeed, the aquatic center must use the lowest cost, fastest building methods and materials. Sprung and Myrtha products are the only way forward to keep down costs to what we can afford."
oLCYTVQZ,Stop trying to shove this thing down our throats! We voted NO.
NRB6z6zn,I strongly support building this facility and having an aquatic facility for our community. Happy to pay additional tax to support!!
nhCi0qb1,"Jefferson County, certainly cannot afford a facility like an aquatic center when their failure to keep up with general maintenance is blatantly obvious! To encumber an already overtaxed population for the benefit of very few is obscene!"
OqEBYhpk,"Please include kid-focused features (lazy river, slide, etc.). We often make the drive to Port Angeles and Silverdale for these features because the Mountain View pool lacks a kid area and it's hard to convince our 8 year old to swim there."
ebCinu1X,Waste of time energy and money. It is my belief there are much bigger priorities than a pool.
L9CYFNBo,Obvious: Try to keep the cost down so more folks will support the tax increase. I sure hope this happens. We have needed this for over 20 years.
2mEBqjKl,Please put in an indoor climbing wall and indoor and outdoor pickleball!  Nothing to do here in the winter!
PACiwVEY,Curious about cost. How will it be funded for construction and ongoing funding. Is the sales tax adequate.   I understand this question has a depends answer. More information is needed.
ySkEzqSM,South County shouldn’t have to pay for something well very rarely use.
BTfHnjpr,"Go for it, but not at my expense."
0UB653Ly,Jefferson County does a poor job of making facilities accessible to disabled residents.  It is imperative that the facility be barrier-free.
NdksaFh6,"We can’t afford life right now. Taxes have gotten out of control. No new taxes until the basics can be affordable again. We are being taxed out of our homes. Food, gas and insurances are too expensive. We barely make it pay check to pay check."
KcEB2buk,I would not use it myself but do know several who currently use the pool regularly and support the new pool and tax increase to finance it.
VWCYUW6I,Having a facility that works with local scuba shops will help facilitate a vibrant community of diving professionals and the general public. It is also very important to have a pricing structure that allows anyone to use the pool while raising enough funds for continued maintenance and growth without the need for outside fickle funding sources such as city or county budgets.
5dCijlc2,"Although myself and husband wouldn't use the facility as much as others, we support having a facility in the county for children & families to take advantage of. That said, we believe having a proposed facility more centrally located is key to its success. If the purposed facility were to be built within PT city limits, we would not support it or the taxes to fund it."
afCihzFV,Good location. Much better than in town. I think a lot of it it needs to be geared to kids. They need the recreation and swim lessons.
GVC4NW2g,More important uses of public funds. Tax rate already high.
srk4CTiJ,I think it is important for our Jefferson county youth.   Also for competitive swimming with a regulation sized pool
GOB62Idy,We're less likely to use a facility in Port Hadlock than a facility located closer to Port Townsend. We would still use it but at a lower frequency because it would require driving to get there.
3hEB26pX,Please don’t raise our cost of living any more than it already is to build a pool. I struggle to afford the high cost of living here as it is.
M5B6BhW6,Port Townsend would be more accessible to more people.
nTCiuIq4,N/A
4fB6QjlM,"Complete misprioritization of need for this county. We’re struggling with basic needs, and shouldn’t be focused so heavily on luxuries at this time. Not to mention, the creation of the PFD and tax hike give us no guarantee you’ll ever actually build an aquatic center. It’s a ruse and a scam by an already untrusted county government. Regroup."
9Qk1CNOV,"Perhaps there is a need for a better facility than Mt. View, but from what I know that facility isn't used much, so when there are so many other perhaps more important matters to attend to in our county, spend tax payers money on a pool. Cut the costs and help PT improve the Mt. View pool. I believe there are already 6 or 7 pools in the county. Do we really need another?"
2mCYYzfN,Just wish the new center was in walking distance of PT
XVDTtouz,it is time to cut taxes  We need to put tax money towards needs not wants
yBC4MV3k,"I currently drive to the Sequim YMCA 2-3 times per week (from Port Townsend) exclusively for masters swimming because they have a coach, a full length lap pool, and overall better facilities. I would love to have a similar program in Jefferson County and would attend as much as possible!"
7nCY66bz,"I think it is imperative to build a new pool with fun amenities for kids that will prevent parents from continuing to take their children out of county to more exciting pools like Port Angeles or Bainbridge Island. This pool absolutely needs to compete with those fun pools to keep our business in this county. Spend money to make money. Include a lazy river and whirlpool. Put in slides, water play features, and make the pool zero entry for those with disabilities or emerging skills. Thanks for all your hard work!"
ZREBdA4z,"This needs to be built as a multi-use fitness center. Pool, weight room, aerobics classes, indoor track around it all."
DKCKAx4A,"I believe you caved to criticism by idiots. Ludlow-ites already have pools. Chimacum and Hadlock residents will not be using the pool the way Port Townsend residents would have. I'm afraid that you will spend an incredible amount of money on a facility that will be ignored by the local residents.  You assumed that you would hear from PT residents. But you did not. Those of us heartbroken by the past and future closure of Mountain View are silent, grieving and not inclined to public speeches and the bullying atmosphere of public meetings. But oh, we would have all shown up in droves to a new PT facility. I know you can't bank on a silent bunch of people. But you could have banked on my daily use. And so many others who never spoke about it."
mPCK1NWs,"If it could have a gym or rock climbing area, we would use this facility up to 6 days a week."
J5CKVL0Y,Money would be better spent in MAJOR and EXTENSIVE repairs to our roads.
uqCi57LE,"Would love to keep the facilities in Port Townsend. Most East county residents have business in the city to accomplish anyway. In my opinion, the facilities will be much better utilized in Port Townsend."
svDTiZ9H,"The facility would be a nice addition, but being so far from Port Townsend my family would likely not use it ... just too far to drive/bike (we try not to drive)."
uCDT5lYr,"For the sake of community harmony and togetherness, I hope we approach a design that could be developed in stages, focusing on a lap pool first. When this project over-reaches is when a larger portion of the community pushes back. All that said, we love having a pool and will use it often!"
Iff5Kt9e,Thank you for considering this. The pool in town is not suitable for children.
8SCK7A4y,I would oike to see the YMCA run the Aquatics Orograms.
1XCiOYNZ,"0.2% isn't small. That would be at least an $800 increase to the mortgage taxes for a home assessed at 400k. We want a pool, but this may need some more creative funding."
51CKf88s,We need a new facility and should not scrimp on one now just because it is expensive. It will get more expensive & a bare bones facility will not provide enough options to have a reasonable ROI.
mCCiEOZG,I will vote against a sales tax to fund this facility. I will lead a community effort to stop any increase in sales taxes in Jefferson County. Sales taxes hurt the poor. Don’t hurt the poor. I will support a property tax increase to fund this facility.
ufCK8D5a,"PLEASE STREAMLINE THE PROCESS, It's good for fitness, physical as well as mental and social."
d4DTntZh,"I am very excited about the possibility that the new center will be located near the primary school and library in Port Hadlock. We take care of our toddler granddaughter 2 days or more a week. I would love to have a place to take her for swim lessons and recreation and I would certainly use a fitness room and the pool 4 or more days a week. Right now we have to drive 5 miles to work out at Evergreen Fitness. I love the idea of a community gathering place/pool/fitness center in Port Hadlock, which IS the designated Urban Growth Area of Jefferson County."
XoB6nRjL,Please build the pool before I’m too old to use it.
GtEBLRAF,"We think the proposed location is a great choice for the community! While we would not be primary users we support a basic pool facility for the counties youth to use. Keep it simple. Pay attention to who the potential users will be and don't over build by getting caught up in a ""Keeping up with Seattle"" syndrome. This is a rural community, not an urban one."
IZkLJE18,This small community should not expend money it does not have. Our budget should include things that are obviously necessary to our area. This is luxury spending.
FYC4sgaC,"I wholeheartedly support the new choice of location, I did NOT support the plan to build the aquatic center on the pt golf course. My main desire for a pool is for others, mainly children who need to learn to swim safely due to our maritime environment"
yqk4cneM,Fix the existing infrastructure.   Update equipment and facilities.
StCKDZa5,"The programs mentioned, such as after school, camps, teen fitness etc, must be well funded, quality programs, with well paid staff. If not, kids won’t want to go. If programs and staff are underpaid or underfunded, the program won’t succeed because the kids won’t show up. It would be wonderful to have more options for youth but only offer it if you can afford to fund it properly."
TJB6es9I,"I think it is essential for ALL kids to learn how to swim proficiently so that ALL adults can swim proficiently, particularly when living amongst so much open water. I was taught in a community pool at 6 months of age and prioritized teaching my children at a young age (but a little older for ears safety). I would love to see a nice, functional pool happen. I don’t believe in anything state of the art or competition level- it is too much financial burden on the majority of this community. I also believe a pool is extremely beneficial to the vast older population for health purposes or for those recovering from injuries. EDUCATION is key. Please promote swimming programs in the school systems (elementary) and make it accessible for all, not just the financially privileged. In the end, I am fully comfortable swimming in our cold waters 6 months out of the year so I do not need this pool, however I do believe it is optimal for all in our community to have access to one, especially if it can be incorporated into our early education programs. If adding a gym or cafe makes it more appealing, so be it. I will support that. Thank you for this convenient opportunity to voice an opinion."
V8fJhlhm,"I am fully in support of an appropriate facility that the community can use for sports, recreation and community events."
clDTAo6O,I like the pool where is is. Would like to see a cafe and workout center on second level
Q0CiZLSO,Outdoor pickle ball is a menace. Please do not include this in your plan. The neighbors will appreciate you. I won’t be able to answer whether I would support a tax without knowing the final cost of the project. I do not have children so the bulk of the benefits for this do not apply to me.
1bCKmlez,"We feel the community would benefit from a full YMCA however, expanding to a full recreational center would increase our likelihood of using it. We believe that having a community space would strengthen the ties we all need to bring people together for fun, recreation and support."
EUC4CoAh,"While we do not have children/teens in our household, we believe strongly in the community value of a place for children/teens to be involved in healthy, activities in a safe environment."
FGfWUGO4,"A new aquatic and rec center is needed. We would use it as much as our schedule allows especially if it had more offerings than our current pool.  It would be great to be able to take swim lessons here instead of traveling out of county. It would be great to add a boys swim team for school. Plus adding fun second like the PA pool & Bainbridge pool have would make it more inviting. Also, if the option for an outdoor pool was an option I could see us regularly coming in the summer! A rock climbing section so we didn't have to travel out of county would be amazing as well."
I0B6Vs59,Sales TAXESARE NOT THE WAY TO FUND CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT BEIFIT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THEY ARE REGRESSIVE IN NATURE AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED. PLEASE USE PROPERTY TAXES AS THE VEHICLE FOR TAXING
eQCYUN32,Will males be allowed in female bath areas and vice versa.
4CCiJwea,The rhetoric regarding pool location was very upsetting and revealing. If it was located in Port Townsend no one in the county wanted to pay for it. Now it is going to be located in Port Hadlock and all Port Townsend folks are primarily expected to pay for it. I'll be glad to have one but it is frustrating to be viewed as unimportant in the process except when it comes time to pay. Obvious that the rest of the country hates us but loves our money. This aquatic center debacle has made that very clear. And now the majority of the people in the county who will use the pool will have to travel 15+ minutes to use it. But glad all those 'no county tax for PT pool' signs disappeared. Maybe we can get a new print run of 'no county tax for PH pool' signs.
48C4dNVO,I would support any new pool
UeDTJq36,Having a pool is very important to me for my physical health.
XcCKIa2t,I think it’s vital to have an available swimming pool because it is such a healthy activity that has none of the downsides that many forms of  exercise have.
cxB6B3Or,"Gym equipment/facilities, rec community sports teams, fitness classes, we would be very excited in all of these things (and of course the pool itself!) our community needs more opportunities like this!"
95CKHOiR,Seniors cannot afford property tax increases.  This project needs to be self sustaining.
pTEBjPZ9,"Have waited a long long time for a new aquatic center, 40 years!  Very much needed and will be appreciated."
wSB6atey,"Preference for the pool to stay in PT, and not be run by the YMCA."
TmCK6FKM,"We do not support a sales tax increase. We do not support another pool, we already have 7 pools in this county and there will be 2 more built in Brinnon soon. Even located in Hadlock, this pool is inaccessible to too many residents and unaffordable."
0ICYM4Iv,I moved to port Ludlow for access to the HOA amenities. Due to this I already pay for these services and would not utilize them. I see the value for the community but I do not think a sales tax is the way to pay for it.
zrkExhca,I think it is a good thing. I grew up swimming every day in the summer and it is great exercise and important for kids who live around this much water to know how to swim.
AGDTtrmm,I don't need my taxes to go up.
ErEBCpJw,My family has lived in Jefferson county since the 1940s we own multiple properties but sadly any more property taxes might force us out of the area. All time and public employee efforts towards something most people don't want seems like a huge waste of public funds.
kkCYlBVv,"I believe this should be in Port Townsend, simply because if population density. Also N/A should am option. There are many services I wouldn’t use because they don’t apply to our family but I support"
YDC4j0fF,"Even tho I'm retired & have a grown son, swim lessons & competitive swimming were a very important part of our sons & our lives. As I age, having access to lap swimming, water exercise & possible water rehab as needed, is important to me. I think part of the problem with getting enough support for a pool, is too grand of a plan with too high of a price. How about starting with a pool that will support multiple needs & add gyms, etc down the road as needed? Our pool was on its last legs 30+ years ago when our son was swimming. We have been trying to rehab/replace it that whole time. It goes nowhere because the wish list is too extensive & expensive for our community to support.  We just need a pool."
zHkrLkba,Fix the roads here first!
SOCKZRve,Ensure adequate parking spaces.
glfXsY4c,"I'm sorry, but our community has many needs of higher priority I'd rather fund with my taxes than this facility. There is so much outdoor recreation here. It's a ridiculous discussion, IMHO."
8eCYZQmg,I am unable to use the current pool due to mobility limitations and the mold in the facility that kicks up asthma. Would LOVE to have access to an indoor pool to stay fit.
FbCiyiLR,"I would definitely support a tax to build a pool in Port Townsend, which is the most densely populated area of the county. I think the pool should be in the city, not Port Hadlock."
cCEBCjA6,"Taxation without representation - this is being pushed through no matter what.  New taxation; then the state legislators are passing more and more taxes, levies and surcharges.  Enough is enough."
F8CKoGqh,"While disappointed that it’s not going in PT, we are happy there’s still a chance of this comprehensive facility being built nearby. We would definitely use it, especially if there’s a shower and locker room."
LTEBQVZJ,"I think it is vital to have a public pool in our community so that EVERY child can learn to swim and understand water safety.   Also, for our county's older citizens, access to a therapy pool and regular water exercise programs is a good way to improve the health and well-being and reduce dependency on our healthcare systems."
JNC4rjcC,Please make it happen!!!!
csDT9DAV,Thanks for your efforts and good luck!
8gCivMDO,"Let’s stay in budget and build a nice new pool, with changing rooms and showers. No pie in the sky wish list. I don’t think people in the county who will vote on this will want to pay increased taxes for non-essential add-ons that could be considered “luxuries”. Budgets are tight - voters’ budgets and the County’s budget. We need to be realistic about costs and about what increase in their tax bills county residents might be willing to accept.  I think the location is a very good choice."
RBkCZKeV,We are a waterfront and a water activities related community. Swimming is not an elective but a mandatory safety issue
c3fqhmpy,I think it’s a very important asset for our community
tXC46auo,If given a vote I would not support approving a tax to pay for this
5RDTboXU,"Taxation is theft. A pool is not an essential government service. If you or others want a pool so badly, pay for it yourself. Have a bake sale or a raffle."
j9CKDZxx,"I’m concerned about the access/egress to the facility. I would not want additional traffic  on Cedar impacting the residents. It seems very unfair for all, (Forks, etc)  residents of Jefferson County to have to pay for a facility that they would rarely, if ever, use."
Z0DTiwe6,No. The county and PT city officials have repeatedly mismanaged money through lack of fiscal responsibility and some outright theft. I will not support raising a regressive sales tax or a tax on unrealized gains in the form of property taxes for this project. Fix the pool we have in PT for 1/10th the budget and build a small educational pool on a very small shoestring and I may get behind this but not with the track record of waste our current elected officials have behind them.
7SCKvKZf,I would like gym equipment
DHCYv7oR,I cannot afford this as alot of residents. There are more very important things to address than a pool. Housing is critical for lower income and non-housed residents.
j1C4iTdZ,"We are on fixed income. We can not afford to pay more and more taxes for stuff we don't want. The city can't even fix the streets, manage a PDA, or build a Cherry St housing project. These decisions and the new one  being made on hiring a new arts coordinator make me want to start voting for Republicans and I have never voted for them. I don't believe the county has the competence to do this and we could end up paying more and more to get us out of a hole. Don't do this. Don't force more of us out of Port Townsend because that is what you are doing. Maybe that is what you want."
e5Cidgeh,"Having this resource will be of key value to Chimacum and PT high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools. A community pool supports a kids growth throughout their life, both physically and mentally. Being able to compete on a team (swimming, diving(?), water polo, synchronized swimming) while in school is key as it allows students of all body sizes to find their lane (as it were).  Please continue to promote the healthy lifecycle of the swimmer. Starting as a youth, learning to swim, then potentially mastering one or more strokes as a competitive swimmer, and/or getting that swimming merit badge, then going on to become a lifeguard, then going on to become a Coast Guard officer, then swimming all through life into your 100's, etc. Pools are great and are a key part of a healthy, active community. Thank you!"
UKkP7NN2,They need to fix the roads not build pools.
rfB6sPan,The pool/aquatic center/fitness facility should be in the only UGA of JeffCo.
ZBfh8p4x,"I am adamantly opposed to taxation of the entire county for a city pool or aquatic center.  If you want it, find an investor and build a business plan that makes sense.  Take a vote of the entire county and see how unpopular this idea is.  Stop taxing everyone for PTs benefit."
fIDT4SZ6,"PRESENTLY… Washington state elected officials are attempting to impose a property tax rate increase, the county wants more taxes/fees to maintain county roads soon there will be a sewer fee. Pool proponents, and BOCC seem to not understand how very expensive it is for working class families, and retirees who do not have big fat pension trying to hold on to homes. We own a 24x60 50 year old mobile home on a 1/3 acre lot and out property tax just went up to $1820.00 a year! PUD is $350.00 a month! how do young families even afford to live here anymore!?!"
CpDThm2k,Thank you for continuing to make a pool happen.
7zCirOJH,Sooner the better. Concerned about MVP breaking resulting in more pool closures
6MCYFAzJ,We’re so excited for a new pool and feel the Port Angeles Pool is a great model. Thank you!!
P8CiAM6H,As parents of a young child we strongly support a safe and fun facility for children to learn to swim - as well as a productive and healthy activity for people of all ages.  Thank you for your hard work!
jwCKprEf,This type of facility is an important resource for our community.
V0CKzFmO,"Well you mention E. Jefferson County then further into the survey you mention Pt. Hadlock. That was weird, have you decided on Pt Hadlock ?"
mlB60nod,"The community would greatly benefit from a large scale community center of sorts. Pool, hot tub, sauna, health/wellness classes, water therapy, rock climbing, sport courts, playground/splash park, cafe, etc. would all be fantastic. Could actually create programs with the library (every 10 books read = free rec swim for kids in summer, is one idea)  Another idea for funding would be organizing a maker’s market of sorts, where a portion of the proceeds goes to the pool… I think the JeffCo community would pitch in on fundraising…  Another suggestion is a bus stop serviced by both the tri area bus and the Quil/Brinnon bus and perhaps some added bus times to increase reach for lower income folks.  Also, perhaps a membership option for more ongoing revenue.  I probably have a million more ideas."
OYEBgMw0,I like the central county location.  I would not use one in PT.  I would love to see  midday (not early morning or late afternoon/evening) water aerobics classes!
v5CKF4ES,"I like the idea of the pool being more centrally located . Probably won't use it much . I think swim lessons for children and maybe a swim teams would be good , instead of just port Townsend having that ability."
aSfbBsmB,We would definitely use it! We are trying to get our little ones to learn how to swim and there are currently very limited options. We would use the pool so much if it opened up in Hadlock!
OPCYeGvN,about the tax increase....how long would that remain?
YwCY8H0x,I would only support an increase in the sales tax IF the city of Port Townsend was not also building a pool and asking for tax revenue.
b7f0YVnj,"While I am not a likely user of a recreational facility, I strongly support having one in our community. The benefits to our community are many."
79CYG3LS,"On a fixed income, have a mandatory HOA  (includes pool); all utilities and food costs rising."
KxCKqVaO,Port Hadlock near the library would be an amazing location and many of our friends with and without families. I can imagine a sauna and hot tub being a huge resource for us as we continue to get older. We also love the idea of creating a space that kids and teenagers would love to be at since that can add so much to the safety and vibrancy of our local communities.
L7C4Epe0,Very excited about a pool for water aerobics
2ECiEJ8T,"Although I am not likely to use this facility often, I see this as a great opportunity for our communities youth. It would be nice to have late night teen nights as well."
t2DTEief,"Jefferson county has a desperate need for accessible swim lessons for children, the current situation is ridiculously unsafe for children growing in proximity to natural bodies of water."
uIEBl11e,This is a much better location!
GLCiivC9,"Waste of most folks dollars. Only those that intend to use it should pay. Taxes, taxes, taxes. This is simply just a few folks idea. Be done with it. Beaches and mountains...thats what we have here."
1ACYLURA,I have grandchildren that also live here locally.  I am looking forward to having a local indoor recreation place to go with them. I am hoping it won't be too costly!!  Would LOVE to have an aquatics center similar to the one on Bainbridge Island!!
mJkyUEI0,I look forward to teaching fitness classes at the new facility.
GHCYCiep,An Aquatic Center similar to The PA Aquatic center is a must. Especially during winter months as well as in the summer. Benefits  of swimming; gentle on the body while providing a great whole body workout .
BhkSi8U9,NO!
yQfYrBpa,This program is not wanted or needed at tax payers expense
6MB6GEDz,I would love to be able to swim weekly and to bring my grandkids in often as well.  We live around the Salish Sea.  The children of our area need to be taught how to swim at an early age.
SgfYY2VK,"Please incorporate a UX team in the process and know what that means. Please make sure that the designers/architects involved have families that swim and understand that families who live here are all working class for the most part and will likely be underrepresented in the feedback process, though we exist in large numbers and want to see a pool designed for families and kids."
8oB6xmki,Please provide multiple lap lanes that are available at all times
A8fDtcjW,"More open pool times and more opportunities for swimming classes, please."
CbkcBTnM,I would like it built in Port Townsend city limits.
okDTMZLT,Not mentioned are possible school programs at the pool. Swimming lessons as part of school curriculum are important for our community near so many bodies of water.
ogC4whAf,Bouldering/climbing gym would be amazing.
t7k2dedg,This county is so wasteful and the mismanagement of our current tax dollars is disgusting.  There is no way I would ever support this.  Just another money grab that most of us who've lived here our whole lives can't afford to absorb.  Let the rich who've moved her with all their wealth pay for it if they want it.  I'll just keep swimming in the bay like my grandma taught me.
BnEBSZis,"We so need a pool! This is one of the few exercises I can do without pain. I’m lucky to live in Kala Point and have access to a pool in the summer but I don’t have access in the winter. I tried the Y and it was so crowded and the intense smell of chlorine in the small space made my eyes burn. And there are so few times that they offer lap swimming because they are sharing the space with the high school, the YMCA day care program and the public. Hadlock is the perfect place to put a pool in a centrally located place."
ycEBerXJ,"We really need a new pool. The Mountainview pool is too crowded, too old, and has chronic problems that force it to close at the last minute. A new pool would be a winner for residents as well as visitors."
wVCKkBLP,We need this facility.
v4C4EOJb,"PLEEEEASE! Thanks for all the work on this, so important and continually struggles to get traction over the years!"
GiCYw0Ll,No New Taxes!!!
PfDTH8gz,"I think this is an amazing idea to add this in port Hadlock, with the sewer going in and Hadlock allowing growth this will be huge for the community especially adding things for older teens to use at the center!"
G0CYiCtc,Let's build it!  The community needs it!  Movement is medicine and a public pool benefits us all.
ygk9mh8z,"I do not use indoor facilities of anybody kind right now or for foreseeable future. I would very likely use an outdoor pool and/or hot tub. If swimming instruction was available outside I would do that. If water exercise was available outside I would use that.  I am a nonbinary transgender man. I have been mercilessly harassed in shared changing/shower facilities all my life pre transition.  I have avoided pools most of my life due to harassment and I barely learned to swim although I love the water. I have never used single gender or shared shower/changing facilities post transition.  unless there are single stall showers and changing rooms, both with full curtains, that are expressly gender nonspecific (all sex/genders), then I would not be using the showers or changing facilities. That would greatly reduce the likelihood of me ever using the pool. On the other hand, if such facilities were available to me, and the pool itself was outdoors, I would envisage pretty frequent use.   I believe a pool is essential for our community. I would love a facility I felt comfortable using.  But I strongly believe we need one even if I were never to use it.    However I cannot support funding that uses a sales tax. This is a very regressive type of tax that puts too great a burden on people with less economic means. It takes a much higher percentage a poor person’s available funds than it does a richer person’s. It also tends to hit harder on  people who do not have the ability to go out of county to do their shopping. I believe it will also be keenly felt by anyone undertaking a major building project here.  The result will be an even greater tendency to purchase materials out of county, for example at big box building suppliers, and that will not be good for our local businesses.    I would also imagine that the sales tax would be applied to services purchased here? Would there be an added tax for dental work? For window washing and roof cleaning or repair? Again, I believe people will increasingly use out of county providers for services and this will not benefit the community.  Please find a less regressive funding mechanism.   I understand that one of the goals of the facility is for use by the public schools. And indeed the new proposed location is to be near a public school.  It seems to me that if the schools are to be using the facility then the school system should be expected to fund some part of it that is equivalent to the anticipated percent of use.  I used to live right next to a school that had a pool that was open to the public during certain hours. I used it once and then never used it. My experience was that the public hours were very short creating a massive competition for space and time. There were so many faster swimmers who were very impatient with beginners like myself.   in the afternoons the schedule was extremely crowded with school-related events, and open swimming ended up being late in the day. Too late and again too crowded.    I fear that having a pool be literally on site of a school will create these kinds of scheduling pressures. And if it is to be used much of the time or half of the time by the schools, then school funding should contribute to paying for it.  I will also weigh in to say that while I appreciate the challenges of building.a new pool on the site of the old pool, a facility in Chimacum will not provide the same level of access to the aging population inhabiting Port Townsend. My observation is that many elderly users currently walk to the pool, and a number of somewhat younger users bike to it.  t. Your survey does not ask about how people would get to the pool.  A number of us elderly folk in the area mask and rarely use public transport because other riders don’t mask. And a number of us are not really comfortable driving long distances.  Biking in this county outside of the city of PT is like handing your life over to a crazy game of a Russian roulette.  My point is that moving the pool out of the City of PT really changes/reduces access for an aging population that would greatly benefit from pool use and from the ability to walk or bike there.    I do not live in the City of PT but I would be way more likely to use a pool located there than in Chimacum: From my perspective it would be a lot better if the pool were located somewhere closer to halfway between.  However, I am under the impression that that ship has sailed And that the site has  pretty much been selected.  I don’t love it. I’ll use the pool less if at all. But I support the pool."
XPCiOI2l,Why should west Jefferson County have to pay?
ngf12Fae,It's a real shame that the idea of building a facility in Port Townsend wasn't fiercely defended by y'all.
GSkKo4JL,Add/modify bus routes to help those who visit and work there.
GvC4Ke4s,No
I7C49Jap,We can’t wait for this facility to be built and would happily join as members or use the pool 2-3 times per week per member of our household. We would love to have more amenities attached to it. Thank you for all the efforts to create this improved facility and space for our community.
LRCK6YuE,"As a parent of a teen and younger kid, I understand the need for additional recreational, childcare, and youth based activities. As a local medical provider I also understand the need for additional exercise and health based services. I highly support this effort and would use the services regularly."
3RCKNTpX,This would be an awesome addition to our community.
WskjkaCq,"I think this would be an incredible benefit to our community, even better that Port Townsend. Also, the timing is perfect because the Habitat for Humanity and Sewer projects are both going to change the landscape and demographics here in the next few years. I love the vision of a more vibrant hub for families here."
vXCiqPti,I would NOT send my daughter to a facility that I felt she wouldn't be safe at.
8dCYTcnz,"There's already an aquatic center is Port Townsend, a year ago Port Townsend tried to get a new pool out of Quilcene funds, that backfired. I'll give you credit for purposing this project in Port Hadlock, in the middle of the county, but with the economy isn't quite suitable for this project and the additional taxes that are to come with it."
jRfNqlw7,"Just fix the old pool. Only a fraction of Jefferson county residents would ever use the new pool, and even among those few who might want to use it, many won't be able to afford the entry fee. It's why I didn't use the old pool - entry fees for regular lap swimming are not affordable, and lap swim times were few and only offered at hours I couldn't go. Aquatic centers always cater most to kids and families, and rarely offer any programs or lap swims at days/times that are attractive to senior citizens. I for one oppose and  resent paying yet even higher taxes for a facility only a fraction of county residents will use. I already pay fees for a pool at Kala Point. I don't want to have to pay for another one. Instead of a new pool, why not fix all our potholes? Put more $ into senior services and affordable one-level senior housing, just to name a few ways the pool money would be much better spent."
uCCKEfi4,Would like to see it built closer to port townsend
dNDTOQTW,We can’t afford this.  We have many higher priorities
x6Cibctn,This would be a huge boost for our family.  We currently go to Port Angeles to swim a couple times a month and to Bainbridge for the rock climbing wall.  Thank you for your efforts and we hope to see this project come to fruition!
b2fKtPbl,"I've been driving to Sequim now twice a week for a number of years to swim. I've been hoping against hope to have a closer pool of similar size. I also do much of my shopping while there so unfortunately my money does not stay local (or at least local to Jefferson County). It's a shame that Sequim and Port Angeles are able to support a pool, and we seem unable to. I thought a decade ago it would happen. Perhaps now. Fingers crossed!"
xyfP6Pa3,"We are over due for a new facility. I encourage you to serve all ages with the design, from the inclusion of a splash pool, exercise pool, and lazy river. I think the Shore Pool is a terrific example. With a good facility that includes options for our full population, I believe attendance will be high.   While I am grateful for Mountain View pool, it has been challenging for me to provide positive aquatic experiences for my kiddo with its limited options and hours for kids. I am also an avid swimmer and spend most of my time open water swimming for the same reasons. A new facility could bring many more options!"
4mEBpDHk,Check out Lopez Island’s new pool. They have managed to break ground and start building in less time than we have been arguing about it.
cUC4sNLq,It's about time
ViEBJpCM,"Crucial that a new facility be built. Will the existing facility be fixed, repurposed or torn down?"
ObCKqxfZ,I think it is important to have amenities like this to attract young families to our community. It would be a partnership with the hospital to bring together people if all ages. Look at the overload of physical therapy needs that the hospital cannot accommodate.  I hope this becomes a reality for our community. Top notch state of the art. Could possibly be built in a way that could grow and expand over time to address costs. Would love a pool that was built in a way for open air when the weather is good in the summer.
qFfUU75M,A slot of time daily for Elder water programs. Elder group exercise.
EnCK85gB,Changing rooms and showers need to be SEX based for reasons of privacy and safeguarding. People who claim different identities can use the facilities that align with their SEX. This includes employees. No repeats of the Julie Jaman YMCA drama.
RQC4EUti,"I’d be super excited if there were a rock climbing area with tall walls (not just bouldering). I’d be excited about a cafe if it served local/organic/made from scratch healthy items. I’d love easy access to a hot tub/sauna. Would love low or no chlorine content. I’d support a tax for the facility regardless of my preferences as I know how important swimming is to many, and was also to me when I was young."
iiCYxUgc,"While I don’t see our current household using a splash park or indoor play area, so couldn’t check those boxes, when the children were young we would drive to Bainbridge or Sequim for their aquatic center. It’s a big need for children in this community."
3CCKpd8f,"Let's build and finish the new sewage system first, before we start other projects."
STC4vRb1,"I prefer Chimicum Park location.  Library area is longer/slower to get to. I don't believe this facility needs to be ""state of the art"" design.  A big pool that lets multiple things happen at one time would be very useful.  I hope this works."
EFC4uRCD,A public pool could help support special education/disabled students by offering therapeutic activities or inclusive swim team training.There are currently no adaptive PE classes offered at the Middle or High school now.
tfCiCOSI,Thank you!!
PYEBqiwx,I answered the questions about youth swim lessons because my grandkids live on Marrowstone and attend Chimacum Schools where I would hope swim lessons are integrated into the PE curriculum so all kids can swim by time they’re 7 or 8.
9UB6iapB,thankful they moved it out of Port Townsend to a more central location.  Good.
z5DTgRjO,We are already being taxed out of our homes. This is an unnecessary expenditure that will further burden our aging population.
k4CYWbbg,Please expedite this!  My kids are 11 and 12 and would benefit from a pool
jrfDvrJl,An aquatic center that supports other health and wellness activities is important for all ages. My children graduated from PTHS in 1994 and 1997. Going to the pool was an essential part of our family together time from their preschool through high school years. We are surrounded by water and I felt more secure knowing my children were excellent swimmers. Now that I'm old I appreciate opportunities to deny gravity while enjoying the pain-free movement of my joints in buoyancy of water. I would support added property tax in support of a Community Aquatic and Recreational Center. I support expansion of Countywide Transit Service to support equitable access. Thank you for this opportunity to share my support.
pdB6y8rg,"I am not a pool user really, but think this would be a great addition to the county. That is where most families live anyway."
GLDTEVZA,2 items.  -When all is done I believe the public would prefer the facility to be in Port Townsend city limits.  -teaching our population how to swim is the cheapest lifesaving insurance we will ever pay for.
hPC44nak,Early AM Adult LapSwimming Workouts. Mountain View Pool is a joke and an affront to any serious lap swimmer
VSEB34ee,I only answered for my household but I think there should be many classes and programs for the youth in Jefferson County.  That is more important to me than my individual needs.  Thank you!
ijCYY1ug,"Keep the focus on the pool without getting too spread out into other fitness needs.   Our household is mutli/generational and we’d use it for lap swimming, 70+ water aerobics, water fitness classes."
mhEBNX9j,I am very excited about the new aquatics center. I am also a climber and would be thrilled to have an indoor climbing gym (preferably rope gym). As a pediatric occupational therapist I’m also excited about job opportunities in the preschool setting or as an aquatic therapist.
uoCK6fST,"I hope we are able to this within the next two years! I am currently driving my child to Sequim for swim lessons, which is very challenging bc I work more than fulltime in port townsend. I would also be much more likely to maintain a family membership if there were gym amenities at the same location. Thank you!"
RqEB2REh,"Valuable but expensive stay focused on priority swimming then build out other desirables as funding allows over time. If membership fee too expensive will not be able to participate as on fixed income. Consider option style memberships, senior and low income rates for optimal levy acceptance"
QVEBS5ms,I’m in my 80s but feel that it’s critical for all ages from babies to elderly to have water training and exercise.
XufBnGgc,Broad use options are so important in a rural community.  Childcare options are also very important even if I would not use because I don’t have children
8JCiPILN,"I live in Port Townsend, but I think the new aquatic facility should most definitely be built in Port Hadlock, and whatever Jefferson county does with the new facility keep the Port Townsend city council OUT OF IT."
fyDTq6WS,"I would take my 6yo granddaughter to the new facilities at least 2x per week.  I would also have her task swim lessons. I would also use the pool at least 2x per week myself. You do not give us in this survey a way to indicate the actions we would take as caregivers and grandparents. I have nowhere to tell you this because she  does not belong to our 2 person “household” even though she is with me 7-8 hours a day.  E.g. I would take her to the pool at least 2x per week.  I have no way of telling you of this.  I also have no way of telling you there are things that definitely should be included, e.g. splash pool, pickleball, youth swim lessons etc., even though I personally could not participate in because of my advanced  age and severe osteoarthritis but that I think should be included.  Also, please do not forget to add a public lounge area with comfy chairs and couches where people old or young could just sit and enjoy talking or watching the other activities.  It is important to have a pool area much like the one in Port Angeles that is interesting, challenging and fun.  It is important that this building should be a permanent structure, not just a hot air bubble."
XZfxKETG,"This would make a positively huge impact on families. We need a community pool/activity center, especially for the children and parents in this community. We would use this facility for swim lessons, play, swimming sports, birthday parties, scuba certification. And, if available, rock climbing and yoga. My kids would be thrilled. As their mom, I would be thrilled! We would be healthier and much happier, especially during the long and dreadful winter months. I wish so much that we can make this happen for our community."
qVfM5hNz,I have been using the pool for almost 28 years since I moved here.  I am 89 years old and probably the oldest person in the water aerobics class.  It is what keeps me going.  I hope to be able to use the facility for many more years.
HZkpgLSG,"An aquatic center is essential for east Jefferson County. Since my husband and I are in our 70s we would use it because water activities and therapies of all kinds are so helpful to our health. But I feel very strongly that a new and extensive aquatic/athletic center would be especially beneficial for the teens, children, and young adults in our community. I've lived many different places and I've seen the positive effects a community based center like this can have on the physical, mental and social health of a city, or in this case a county. We support this effort 100%. We may not live long enough to use it but our many younger family members who live here will definitely use this facility and benefit from it. One more thing, such a facility will also will improve value in multiple ways for east Jefferson County. Thanks!"
96C4gFoZ,"This will be life changing for our community.  As an elder, swimming/rec center will be great adjunct to health and well being/aging in place."
i0CYbtRt,I liked both the aquatic and non aquatic options available. Make sure there is oversight so it doesn’t become a big children’s playground and deter adults from using facilities.
lTkenf3f,I love the proposed location!
f4EBOQhv,Please build it!!!
zICKyfSC,I think a pool AND recreation facility is an essential piece of infrastructure for  a growing Jefferson County.  I support a full facility that crosses all age groups and their physical needs.
7PCiFl46,"Thank you! Though we live in PT and would have used a facility in city limits more frequently, we will definitely drive to Hadlock to the new pool if it is warm, has kid friendly features, swim lessons and hot tub/sauna. Please keep these features in the design! Otherwise we will continue to drive to PA and Bainbridge with friends bc it brings our children so much joy. But we’d rather stay local! Thank you JAC for all your work over the years. We’re getting so close!"
GBEB3WBl,"I will only use the pool if it salt water (non chlorinated). Myself, and many others, have medical problems aggravated by chlorine."
DjB6RiAL,"My personal thoughts are that County voters won't support a pool no matter what. So, this will all go back to the city at some point. Meanwhile, the Mountain View pool continues to age...as do I"
Duk7DKp0,"We certainly need a new facility!, especially a pool."
ziCiAZ8H,I’ve stopped using the PT pool because of the limited and inconsistent hours— which I understand is due to staffing shortages. I’d like to see a solution to that addressed before voting for another short-staffed pool.
iTk5KbHW,"Please, for once, prioritize our younger community members!"
hDCKy6d0,"Yes pool! Thank you for continuing to work on this. We strongly encourage a multipurpose facility, the encompasses pool and other  multi-age community activities (indoor gymnasium, climbing wall etc). It’s so important to have a variety of activities for youth in the area. The reality is we would use it more if it was in PT but happy to drive to Port Hadlock if that location makes sense for the community. It just means instead of getting a membership and using the facility multiple times a week, we would more likely use it on the weekends (and pay per use)"
H7kuc111,I am thrilled!
4lC49UQ2,Very excited
3OB6R6eO,"Answers depend on what happens to Mt View.  If it remains open with a minimum cost pool fix, then use of Hadlock will be lower."
61C4M5Xi,Given our average age in this area we need a pool to accommodate health and wellness of older individuals!
ccCiyzpp,"Everyone, babies to the elderly, need a safe aquatic facility.  This is the 4th or 5the effort since I've been in Jefferson County to make this happen.  It serves the community, not just those that use it. Clearly, it's a investment in the well being of our community. Why?  With thanks to Bonnie Tsui, ""Why We Swim"": Survival (everyone should learn to swim for safety), well-being (health, feeling of agelessness in the water, therapy), community (exercise together, rehab together, kids learn to swim together), competition (youth swm teams, master swim groups), and flow (it's meditative)."
H3C4fH1m,"I have lived here 19 years. I am old and disabled now and would have loves a water walking class  for a few years. Before that--defintiely lap swimming and maybe Master's swim..Before that water aerobics. Also,now, a good therapy pool like the one in Sequin.. We are surrounded on three sides by water. We need a decent pool.Thanks."
O8B64JMP,"I didn't see any fitness equipment mentioned.  I would use several times/week aerobic machines, weight lifting equipment though my focus would be aquatics"
PFftjF3F,"Every child and adult should learn to swim. Aquatic exercise is valuable for everyone. For these two reasons, along with the wonderful additional activities the aquatic recreational facility could provide, I strongly support a new aquatic recreational center that can serve the larger community. Even if I don't personally use it, I would like my community to have it available."
NQCYyEbf,Fitness equipment!
dOEBmk5j,"I am completely against the add-ons like climbing wall, kitchen, party spaces, child care, classes etc and will not support the pool if they are part of the plan."
IYk07gJl,"The most important is for the aquatic facility to serve all ages from youth, to mid-life, to seniors. Our county is surrounded by water - we must teach safety and swimming skills! As a part-time YMCA lifeguard (who hadn't planned on working but realized how critical my role would be to keep the pool open in the community), I see every possible walk of life use the pool. It is BUSY. And each day I am at work, at least one person thanks me for filling that role. From school-aged children in swim safety programs and swim lessons at an early age to middle and high-schoolers participating in swim clubs and teams, to seniors doing aqua fitness and water walking, our community has a responsibility to support physical and mental wellness. Further, this facility must be accessible to all, regardless of age, demographics, and socio-economics. This is not the time to build an upscale facility that mimics a private club."
0dDTCMCJ,I believe there will be much more use with an upgraded and attractive facility.
IECYUHuL,"I understand Hadlock is ""central,"" but it is not convenient for us... too long a drive."
oQDT2u0K,Keep moving forward
WyCYqlaO,We don't need more taxes.
ArEBxKFY,I fear that my children will have grown up by the time that this process resolves into a new facility.
aFB6LT2B,I prefer a pool in port townsend city
WoB6dKyp,"I used to work at Mountain View as an instructor, lifeguard, and swim teacher. And I think making it a comfortable place for the employees to work as well as making the wage far."
Uifkmk2l,"My wife and I take care of our 2-year-old granddaughter a few days a week. We would definitely bring her there for swimming lessons, rec.play, play groups, whatever is offered. My wife would swim and attend water aerobics classes, and we both would use a fitness room several times a week."
pJDTAa0Y,My answers do not include how strongly I feel about school age kids in Jeff Co having the opportunity to use a new recreational facility that is centered around their activities- not mine or my age mates(75+).  Let’s do this for the kids and locate it in Port Hadlock!
Cqk3vddS,For the health and well being of this community it is needed!
p6C4Rnvv,I would be more likely to use the pool if it were in Port Townsend.  I hope the city will close the Mountain View pool which is a drain (pun) on city finances
Xrf5qhft,Multi purpose in all areas       Add diving well
bfB6RlPB,I am enthusiastic about this opportunity becoming a reality! I realizing the importance of pool water fitness and its value for all ages! Aqua aerobics is a fabulous way for seniors to stay fit without gravity!!
0FCiaDFw,"When my children were young they all became members of the PT swim team and attended many swim meets at other pools.  Of course this was after taking swim lessons.  I also swam on an adult swim team that attended meets with other adults. Those were good years. Now as an older person, I would be at least enjoying the therapy part of using a pool. It is easier on the body to do therapy in a pool and I would enjoy the hot tube area if available."
vQC4rbti,Note the age(s) of the respondent.
ZrEBLnWu,It would be a dream come true!
LUCKEZa0,Work on housing before you do this.
Brk8aDuZ,Very important to community. It really is a necessity. Love the idea it can be used for all ages.
UfCY1TCW,"There were no questions about disability friendly innovations or programs. I would like to see this in the options.  Hot tubs yes, how about cold plunge or cold room facility?  I would like to see this as a walkable facility to get too. Less cars. Please plan all of this with a walkable neighborhood vibe for those of us who already live in the area. I know there will be cars, but if you make it walkable to those who live here, then there will be less cars. Bike lanes too.  The taxes. Times are hard. Get creative with those less fortunate on fixed incomes or disabled home owners. They are the ones who are going to hurt or be pushed out of their homes to fund stuff like this. They live in Hadlock because it is more affordable. What will you do for them to stay here while we improve our county offerings.? The taxes need to be less painful for those people who have been here a long time and are just trying to survive. How do they get to have access to an amazing space, but still afford to eat or pay for their house? Sone can afford these taxes. Some cannot."
idB6bJTX,"Public transport links could be extended, especially in the early evening. There is a 3 hour gap before the last #6 bus scheduled to return to Port Townsend."
TeDTioHr,Fix the current pool. People are already over taxed and struggling. Why would you keep adding to their burden?  For many people it takes away from their food budget. Very disappointing.
8YCYmc3s,I don't think it's fair for non users to have to help pay for this luxury.  Plus the increased traffic would be detrimental to the peace and quiet we enjoy out here.
xzC4dc5Y,Building a Sprung type structure is less costly.  Landscaping can soften the appearance.  Adult Daycare might be nice considering the age of community members.
taEBYm0T,It’s likely I’ll be gone before this is ever built.
4TEB9LQG,I support the efforts to build a new aquatic and recreation facility in East Jefferson County.
bZDTSqFz,I think this is great! I would likely support a small sales tax to help pay for it but I would like to see more information about how much it’s going to cost and other sources to pay for it.
JCB6dRco,We’ve been waiting a long time. Let’s make this happen.
DBC4KILG,It would be great to have a masters adult swim program there.
QLCYt6pL,Get it done before we have no pool
F1CiXfoC,The City of Port Townsend should partner with the YMCA  to build and operate a pool within the city limits. Leave the County Commissioners out of it. I don't want a pool in Chimacum.
jwB618R1,I may use it more as I age. I really hope for kayak practice here instead of driving to PA.
JCB62S2O,We don't need a big fancy pool! Fix the existing one! We can't afford a new pool! Our town is on the brink of being bankrupt within 10 years! We need to stop spending frivolously!
DOk0UyW1,"""Dry"" facilities--including weight and aerobic exercise equipment--will reduce and perhaps eliminate the need to subsidize operation of the aquatic facilities."
UJEBwK5x,"operate twice-daily shuttles between the Aquatic Center and locations of large user groups, e.g., Port Townsend, maybe Port Ludlow; or help self-organizing shuttle groups from locations like Cape George, Quilcene,etc., the goal being to minimize new traffic generation and to assist non-driver groupings such as older seniors, students, etc."
PxCYmzAP,"I understand why the county wants the site in Port Hadlock.  However, I live in Port Townsend, which is the biggest population center in the county, and it would not be convenient for me to make it to Port Hadlock frequently.  Port Townsend really needs its own adequate pool."
AnDT6h5r,Do not build this pool using any kind of tax dollars. It will only serve the community of Port Hadlock and it is wrong to increase taxes county wide for an unwanted pool. We can not afford more taxes. When does the spending stop?
L5CKXRUj,I would love to have a pool at the park near Chimacum High School
VbC490NY,"Way too many Christmas Tree Ornaments on this.  We do not need a lazy river or other things.  It will not be a major tourist attraction, nor will it attract more high roller real estate investors. People come to our area from urban environments to enjoy our natural features. We just need a basic pool for the year around folks.  Swim lessons are important along with water aerobics.  Stop trying to duplicate services that are available in our community.  Also, more honesty as to the full impact of the tax increase."
y8CKAGov,I'm very excited at the prospect of a new aquatic center.  Traveling from my home to PT takes 30-35 minutes which is not a great incentive to go to a pool with erratic hours.
Zpku3rIr,There are so many other needs in the county that should be addressed first.
NYEB8iBQ,"Dedicated lap swimming lanes at LEAST 25 yards (meters even better!) in length.   In any case, please don’t build a short pool (20 yards) like the Mountain View pool. It shortchanges youth—they need to be able to swim in at least a competitive pool. Us older folks like it too. Thank you!"
IFC4A0II,Glad to hear this project is moving forward
cvf56weM,"I am a Port Townsend resident and am a frequent pool user.  I swim laps 2-3 times per week, take my 3 year old grandson once a week, and my 11 year old granddaughter is a member of the swim club.  The pool in Port Townsend is very busy with people of all ages.  I am very happy you are doing this survey now.  It should have been done before  the committee made its report to the city council.  Even though there are more people living in the Tri Area, how many adults are potential pool users.  I’m sure the facility would be well used by kids. Since the demographic of Port Townsend is older the pool is an essential facility for maintaining health.  I’m not sure how many older residents would make the drive down to Port Hadlock.  Thank you for reading this."
pcB6uk1L,Our family has been wanting to have this since moving here. (20 years)  Please find a way to do make it happen.
KXDTOKXz,"I am concerned about the financial sustainability of the proposed facility for two reasons: 1) The 2014 YMCA Market Feasibility Study concluded ""The Mt. View Commons location is well accepted by the market, but the Port Hadlock location is not. If the Y were built at Port Hadlock we estimate that the forecast would have to be reduced by about 50% of the forecasts shown in the report.""   2) The non-aquatic amenities being considered do not include some of the largest revenue producing one such as exercise and weight equipment. Self-sustaining aquatic recreation centers (such as the Sequim Y) need these to be financially sustainable (not including debt servicing).  This means that the PFD funds will be needed for operational funds and thereby this reduces the PFD resources that can be used to service debt."
MhB6V3C3,So excited about this project! Thank you!
VCffPFam,"I don’t use the Mountain View Pool. I really dislike the existing pool. I swim at  Ft Worden instead, but would rather have a good pool for lap swimming 3-4 times a week (and maybe for old people water polo)."
Y1CiT6rD,I think it is fantastic that Chimacum/Pt Hadlock area will have access to a community facility.  It’s about time!
lcCYVV4U,My son and I REALLY hope this facility and all its trappings happens!!!!!
LCkM7RYw,"I think a yoga studio away from the noise of the pool and an adult rock climbing area would be great! Bonus points if the gym has a running / roller blading track around the perimeter! Thank you for asking these questions, very thoughtful!"
POC49ayt,Really looking forward to this facility!!!
GGCiD3AU,The funding should be provided by use of the facility. People who don’t use it should not have to help fund it
YACYQT0F,Please build us an awesome center like port Angeles! I would be most likely to use if it was salt water or very low chlorine and full length.
13fmjT8o,I am a dedicated user of the PT pool and I live in PT.  I think you have made good choice for a new pool site.
3efEpsrP,Good luck!
JJB6rw8Y,"Please consider the pros and cons of those new  types of community pools that that quick to install and surprisingly durable/long-lasting, if properly maintained. I think they were featured online as being made of very durable vinyl, and showcased by several small, active communities to serve the public: schools with competitive swimmers, etc. and could also be built indoors within a sports complex with a small indoor track above the pool's perimeter!."
NXk3oLt6,This should be a privately funded project not a tax for everyone. This is being rammed down everyone’s throat at the behest of a few rich people that don’t want to spend their own money! It’s a loud NO from me dog!
b1fsiWF2,I think the spot you picked is great
vnDTUab9,"I hope this survey will be effective in assessing the level of interest in the facility.  I don't expect to use it, but I  think it's really important for families, schools, avid simmers, and older people."
VFkJHCeG,"I worked at Mountain View for almost 8 years, was on the high school and club teams and coached and participated in two renovations of that facility. It needs to be replaced. We have a very important need for aquatic instruction in our community!"
nRfR1Wfk,This is so important - thank you! I would appreciate different pools to accommodate the various temperature needs of different aquatic activities.
GXfqcgU1,An Aquatic and Rec facility is needed. Just keep uppermost in planning that we are a rural collection of villages and one minuscule town or a large village. We are not Bellevue!! Modesty should be our guide vs the grandiosity from elsewhere!
TmB6MLF8,Our community needs this. Thank you!
YKCiYUV7,"Glad it is going in Hadlock.  Wonderful opportunity to have it by the library, school, and new habitat development."
93CKGPHp,This is not needed and I don't want this next to my home or the traffic that it will bring
6QDTO648,"I would like to see public showers available  for walkins with a reasonable price (Less than $10), - no membership required - for those living in 'compromised' situations who just need to get clean.  Being able to get clean is healthy for mind, body and necesaary for holding down a job."
IaDTEI5L,My husband and I are in our 80's.  How LONG would we have to wait for a new pool to be DONE??
mXB6zHHx,Sauna in addition to lap pool would be good
dukUKh1S,The pool should have been left at mountainview. The negotiations where within a hairs breadth of a great deal for everybody. A minimal tax for the public. The county commissioners from outside the city vetoed it because they were afraid of losing voters. Most of the people that use the pool are closer to mountain vew than chimicum. More traffic on our 2 lane highway. Deeply dissapointed in the decision to move the pool!
esCYDfVw,Thank you for a well planned process.
JdkZ8Euc,Taxes are too high already
vSffgAzf,Important for the children of Port Hadlock to have affordable access.
2mf4V8P0,"Honestly, the pool needs to be in the most populous area of the county, PT, or have air pollution ( vehicle emissions) become a problem.  I would like the opportunity to complete a survey of this sort for PT, it was never offered!  This makes it totally unfair.  The last attempt suffered by voting by yard sign!!! That is not democratic!!"
DwC4I5ll,"I had polio in 1954 and had to stop my 1.5 mile daily walks a couple of years ago because of leg weakness. Swimming is the perfect exercise for me. It's why, as a teenager, I because a very accomplished swimmer. We had a small cottage on a lake in Michigan. I would swim the 3/4 mile across the lake and back at least once a week, plus every day swimming and diving."
KOB6XgFT,"Having a pool / hot tub that is accessible would be a godsend. I would use probably 4 out of 7 days a week.   I was doing that when covid broke out.     I raised three boys and we swam at the current pool ,  I taught them all how to swim well before the age of two,  because we live by so much water knowing how to swim and what to do in emergency is necessary to know in my opinion."
JnDToM7d,Our community’s health and well-being needs this pool! Having these facilities will keep families here in this loved place. Please do research on the benefits and positive outcomes of access to aquatic centers in rural communities.
ewDTcogq,We don’t need any new taxes. Already being taxed out of our homes. A lot of us are on a fixed income and can’t afford this.
gGCYDfUc,Hoping we can move forward on this. Would be so great to include a cafe and some informal gathering areas so it could be socially community building!
M8CYfY3A,"We already have 4 pools in Jeffco, one in Sequim, one in Poulsbo and one in Silverdale."
vlC4e1Ai,"Because I live in Quilcene, an aquatic center in Hadlock is MUCH more appealing to me than a center in Port Townsend. I would use it primarily for therapeutic purposes."
pDCijLCq,When Maureen Joyce sold this property for a school to be build she was still one of the biggest advocates for keeping this town rural and the push for this outrageous property and taxes from non locals who have history here it only hurts this community and families that have been here for generations.
1iCKv0Ne,Many other more important things to use taxpayer money for.
TVC4jiBH,Hope this works out for our county. Like the concept of Port  Hadlock even though I live in Port Townsend
qiklwO9g,I would like it to offer arthritis exercise class.
pckxM9ub,"Really hope this gets passed! Us parents have a difficult time attending city meetings to provide our perspective due to children's activities and all that comes with parenting. So, I feel our voices are underrepresented in public discussions. Thanks!"
HsCYVcea,"The location is not ideal for the majority of Jefferson County kids, adults, and seniors.  The 20 mile radius used in the analysis ignores the number of miles traveled by users.  A Port Townsend location is much more practical and earth friendly!"
ilDTSLS2,Good luck! Thanks for doing this.
Z3fDx3nF,It sounds very interesting. It is very necessary.
j3DTnAR9,We need more access for youth in this area to succeed! Youth Basketball has such a need for more gyms! We have kids that want to accelerate their levels but there isn’t enough gyms to accommodate the alternative programs. I’d love have swimming lessons accesible to help them gain confidence.
LECijRkw,Absolutely support this facility. Glad the location has been picked. Seems to benefit a larger part of the community in that location.
8IC4efqQ,"The survey questions sound like the plan is for an outdoor unheated pool. We think an indoor pool is crucial. We also think there need to be adult free swim times so we could do water aerobic or physical therapy in the pool. Earlier questions in the survey regarding our current pool use: the Mountain View pool is awful, we don’t use it. Other places we have lived and had access to a pool, we swam at least once a week. Best of luck. We are loooong overdue for a better aquatic facility for our kids, for our aquatic safety, and for the better health of the county."
ACDTtK5v,Super opportunity to build community resilience and connection through healthy activities! We’re all for it!
7cCK7yhV,"An aquatic recreation facility is very important to the community. It is used by residents of all ages, from small children to senior citizens."
PKfogzzf,We live in a marine environment. Everyone desrves lifesaving training in water. Prefer a first class aquatic-focussed center to spreading among multipurposes too thin. Also would like to see preservstion of gsrden learning space  for the school. Support focus on children and youth-hopefully open 7 days and long enough hours for various populations of swimmers. Thank you for all the work invested and opennessto community input.
qREBORfA,"Seems like the wrong location. Port Townsend, city limits, makes the most sense for density, walkability and access to other amenities while visiting the pool. Hadlock is closer than our favorite pool in PA so that’s good - just hope the users show up so it doesn’t go broke!"
vcC4FVBG,NO NEW TAXES
BrCYi6MB,"Just build something, anything! We need a pool. Whatever we can actually get done and approved is what we should do."
73fLKD84,STOP SPENDING MONEY YOU DONT HAVE! Quit trying to steal more of my paycheck!
rFDT2M3G,We are a multi generational local family of 6 who uses MVP 3 times a week each. As boaters water safety is critical for this community and we use this pool to teach all our kids and their friends. We all use therapy pools for arthritis
r2foM3Ud,It would be a great addition to our growing community.
q1C4Qars,Think location near county library an excellent idea.
E2fauW8A,We back it 100%. The youth need this.  The 55+ need this.  Please make it a reality.
mWCYhObs,"If you can find a way to prioritize children and families then I will consider using this facility. Considering the sad state of many other public facilities (drug and alcohol paraphernalia, mental health crisis playing out, etc), I cannot imagine taking my child to this facility unless I know it is actually going to be a family friendly location. If we can’t guarantee these things, then it is not worth the tax dollars. Frankly, I’d rather support these kinds of facilities through our school districts, so that we limit the traumatic exposure to the children in our community."
F7DTZ5sp,Increasing taxes for everyone to support a facility that comparatively few residents will use is unfair.  Charge a sufficient usage fee on those that use the faculty to construct and maintain it.  Seniors like myself on fixed incomes do not need or want the extra tax burden for something we won't use.
lIkTg099,"This is absolutely critical for the health of my growing children and myself and husband as we age. Without a good aquatic center we are less likely to retire here. Aquatic fitness is unparalleled for rehabilitation and health. We need warm water and a steam sauna too for our health living in such a damp/cold climate. Additionally, swimming is a basic survival skill that all kids in our county need. We are surrounded by water and yet so few children know how to swim. Please please make this project happen."
bvB6cb5G,Having it in Port Townsend matters more than something fancier or additional facilities further away from here
FxftImWl,I'm very concerned about long-term operational costs if we expand the scope of the project beyond aquatics.  We need a funding solution that doesn't burden west county for an amenity they will never use.
J6B6cQnT,we need a new pool. period. I would use the pool more than once a week for myself and bring my grandkids more than once a week . I would take advantage of classes if offered for myself and grandkids. Every kid needs to learn to swim and our aging population needs to have water therapy options
TKB6CYS1,"Jefferson county is pushing families out with how much we already pay in taxes. Theres not enough jobs and housing here, why cant we focus on that first? You will tax us out of this community and have an empty pool and building to show for it, the schools will soon be the same. This is so wrong and i don't know why people cant see why its so expensive to live here, i wanted my kids to grow up and graduate here but i don't see that happening if we lose our house to how much our mortgage goes up. I am sorry but i am against the idea. I feel its wrong to force people to pay for a swimming pool."
p1C4dyGt,This center would really help strengthen local community and give the youth a healthy environment to spend time after school.  This county really needs vibrant community center.  It has done well in PA at the Shore Aquatic Center.
D2EBoqGd,"Keep the pool in the city limits of Port Townsend , not using tax dollars"
0NEBVZlE,I prefer to swim in natural water and do not support spending money on a facility when there are so many water venues available
9eEBXffg,I am completely against it
Bfk2vabQ,Teach Zumba or Aqua zumba
kHB6dtz3,The children/families in this town need more recreation options.  Thank you for considering this and keeping that in mind.
DACKPlft,"Don't try to get too fancy with extra like gym or pickleball. Focus on a pool.  Like Bainbridge or PA.   Lazy river, kid area, lap area, sauna hot tube.  Meeting room to rent out for parents.   We'll equip locker rooms. Don't get me wrong the extras are great. But it's been 35 years of discussing a new Y pool with all these extras and no way to accommodate all. So maybe just focus on a pool."
w6CYdhJS,"I have zero interest in an additional tax to pay for this facility. Since all the data collected to date indicate only a tiny percentage of the population would ever use it I don’t believe the population at large should be underwriting it in any way, shape, or fashion. There are far higher priorities in the county that should be addressed before this is considered."
6TCiNfcZ,"I have been swimming at MVP my entire life, and competitively since I was five. I know how important it is to have a new facility in a central location in order to give access to every part of the county, but I do not think Port Hadlock is the best location. Currently, I try to use MVP as much as I can, but know that if the pool is in Hadlock, I could not bring myself to spend the resources driving twenty minutes to swim. I  believe building a pool in  Port Hadlock would significantly decrease the number of PT residents able to use the facility. I think the best, most central location would be in an area close to the U-Haul, which would provide equal access to all Jefferson County residents."
fzC493f3,"I would like to suggest forming a ""special district"" for the tax base. The people in western Jefferson, who would not travel this far for a pool should not, and would not, support a tax for this pool, and the proposition will fail. By developing a ""special district"" the tax will target those most likely to use the facilities."
GpCilHJq,"Very important for youth in area to learn to swim since we have water around us. This would aid to their safety and allow them to more fully enjoy the water (surfing, kayaking, swimming, boating, etc.)"
e0CiptTt,"As usual, the major population centers want to force the rest of us to pay for something that will not benefit the rest of us. When someone visits Fort Worden, the residual spending, (gas, groceries, restaurant, recreation,) all go to Port Townsend and the Tri- Area. Nobody leaves Fort Worden and drives to Quilcene or Brinnon to spend on those residuals. The location of the aquatic center, (Hadlock, preselected as the site indicated in this survey,) will greatly benefit the tri-area again excluding Brinnon, Quilcene and, of course, the west end of the county. Still, your expectations are that we will gladly help pay for something that we in the more neglected corners of the county will not directly benefit from is the norm and, like the Port of Port Townsend levy from a few years ago, will be shoved down our throats and we will be paying out even more in taxes in this less than inspiring economy."
PNk3MJZE,"It’s a very positive effort that benefits everyone. My only concern is keeping it affordable for lower-income folks, including any taxes that may be necessary. Also, curious about public transportation options. Thank you!!"
s8kJ4Juz,The endeavor is a fool’s errand. We would not use and have no interest in investing via tax or otherwise to support this initiative.
yEkAXOb0,"As a newcomer to the area, I find it very upsetting that Jefferson County would expect those of us in the Southern part of the county be penalized financially for something we will not be able to utilize. I believe that Brinnon has suffered enough through recent and previous actions for things that Brinnon has to contribute financially to. I think its time to re-evaluate this project.  As mentioned, I am new to the area from out of state and truly upset and disappointed that Jefferson County has fought the new resort development so hard in Brinnon. So do you think that Brinnon does not deserve it? One thought is...why would JFCO not want those additional tax dollars that could help Brinnon thrive and become an area similar to Port Ludlow? This town has so much potential and if that were approved, this small town might actually become a highlight to the county instead of being a thorn in JEFCOs xxxx!   I am at the point I would like to sell and I am one of the most expensive home in my neighborhood and because of all the actions recently, I would never be able to recoup the outrageous price I paid for my home. To say I regret coming here is understatement. Please consider helping this town become something, not penalize it with useless projects that will not benefit  us and give us the resort! Maybe consider that if Brinnon had this to bring in more financial contributions to the county, the citizens would not object as much to things in other parts of the county."
icEBLbpA,Yes please!!! The pool in Port angeles is the best! Literally my kids love it and make the drive so often I'd love to have one just in hadlock!
dNCK3ITQ,Child swim lessons would be amazing!
70Ci1YJV,Much like the reason we drive to port Angeles is the fact the aquatic center is designed with not only adults in mind. With Jefferson County not having anything for Children I think it would be important to design an aquatic center that makes the area more appealing to tax paying families with children. A lazy river or splash pad would bring more families and use. A square pool is going to make families continue to give money to outside counties. The short drive is not going to outweigh the amenities found other places. Instead of being cheap I would rather pay more in taxes and entry to an appealing aquatic center. There are enough private pools in the area that are squares designed for lap swimming. A diving board and lazy river appeal to all ages.
bwfYRCgj,"I've been wishing for one to be close by for years. I truly hope this happens and I hope it stays affordablefor families. The youth and the community need this. Having a place to go during bad weather especially, which is majority of our year."
NACYa4Ie,We need a new pool!  Let's get started!!!
J1fNVQXB,"Well chosen location, thank you. Central to the county in a much needed development area."
tZEBe7lW,"I grew up swimming at mvp, my first job was as a Lifeguard there, I've seen first hand how important the pool is to all age demographics of Jefferson County. Throughout high school I was lucky enough to have my great grandma drive me to swim team practice every day after school and morning dive practice on weekends but many kids, especially those farther into west jefferson missed out on the opportunity to participate due to the distance/lack of transportation. Our current pool as loved as it is has been holding our local swimmers back in a number of ways, it's not standard length nor deep enough for diving. Because of that we couldnt hold meets at our home pool and had to commute to sequim for dive practice, thankfully the coach was willing to drive us all himself. A new aquatic facility in a more central area of Jefferson County would greatly benefit the whole community and widen the opportunity to participate in aquatic sports for more young people in our area."
ZnEB8lS9,"Love the work y’all are doing to make this happen, and I hope it all works out!"
f0EBMiVI,"Please just build a pool, I have multiple chronic illnesses and it is an ideal form of exercise for me!"
u5CYtqVG,I was hoping it would be at the property across from HJ Carroll park. That area could use positive development and would have more parking.
tIB639uQ,"If there was a lazy river, I’d be there daily and support it 100%z Also, I filled this out for me and my husband, but we have grandchildren in the area, and we’d take them all the time, and they’d need all the activities and teen programs, as well as the lessons, etc., and stuff for younger kids. Even though their parents will hopefully fill out the survey, we would be the ones taking them a lot of the time."
UVDT4N15,I think the Port Hadlock location is a terrible long term planning decision that will make sprawl and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions & traffic worse. I'm sad that bad politics has led to bad policy.
kfB6tRLr,What a fabulous location. Nearby schools and homes with kids that will thrive with a facility like this!
jqDTZdLo,Id like to see activities for young kids with developmental disabilities
aMEBmc53,"Although my kids are ready to leave for college, I think about what we would have loved when we were a young family. A large, state-of-the-art pool facility would have been a dream come true in Jefferson County and we would have used it all the time. I hope that we can bring this valuable resource to the families of Jefferson County, and not shortchange them in favor of louder, older voices."
X5kd4xEE,Both my children learned to swim at the local pool and went on to competitive swimming. Kind of sad the peninsula doesn’t have a real swimming pool.
XoCYTjoD,"I think it's a positive step to have this facility in the Tri-Area as that's the most likely area for family affordability.  Although I'm unlikely to use the pool, I support it.  I'm a PT resident"
OjkVtylM,"So excited about these prospects! I grew up swimming in the PT pool, and now take my 16 month old for swimming lessons in the SAME POOL! I’m thankful it’s there but it’s so in need of some updates. Really looking forward to sharing a new pool with my family and community members! Thanks for doing what you do! We support a new pool!"
iYC4rDSF,"The facility should focus first on families, including toddler, youth, and teen options. I would be more likely to support a tax for the cost if the design and programs to be offered were known (including schedules, etc.) and family focused. I’d also be more likely to support a tax for a different larger site that could support more activities, facilities, and parking. Consider a special temporary tax (like seattle did to pay for the new stadium) so residents feel confident the tax will only pay for the facility and once it’s paid for go away"
AjEBz3RC,"Don’t ask the full county to help pay for this. Too many folks live too far away, and too many folks are non swimmers. It’s a sure way to sink this before it even gets off the ground. And don’t build something super extravagant trying to be something for everyone. It’s an aquatic facility. Stick to aquatics."
0MCiQY47,We don't want another sales tax increase for a pool we will never use. Senior citizens are being taxed to death these days!
73EB3yjW,"As a disabled veteran, I've found water exercises quite beneficial."
mACiNoso,It needs to support as many people as possible. My answers are for my demographic.  I'd love to be able to swim for fitness!!
yfCKtY64,I would love a new pool! The Mountain View pool has not been updated since I participated in the middle school swim team 15 years ago and the state of it keeps me from visiting the pool at all in 2025. The cost of a YMCA membership is
7DC48nSO,The facility doesn’t need to become a haven for the homeless
JcfMcSzT,It would be so awesome if it were a saltwater pool especially for lap swimming.
wwCYANHQ,I would use the local pool in PT more if hours were longer and less crowded for laps
oIC4IiTT,Kid swim lessons!!!! Adult swim lessons!!!! Decent length lap pool!!! More lanes for kao swimming!!! Thank you :-)
orEB355p,"We regularly visit the Mountain View Pool.  Port Hadlock is too far for us to travel for lap swim.  Buses from PT do not run frequently enough to accommodate the non-driving population’s utilization of a Port Hadlock pool.  Our household wants to see Mountain View pool maintained, and we would pay a sales tax for that.  Another concern:  Nearly all of the high school swim team members are PTHS students, so if Mountain View is not maintained, approx. 20 students would need to be bussed to Hadlock 6 days a week.   We would pay a sales tax to support Mountain View.  We’re not in favor of doing anything that will lead to the closure of our existing pool."
z9DTtytg,"Please include a 1/8-mile indoor walking track, such as the Silverdale YMCA has. It would also be nice if we could choose our preferred water temperature for showers. (Mountain View showers have one temperature - you can't take a cold shower.) Diving boards would be great as well."
yYfPMcy2,I'm so grateful that the location has been changed to Port Hadlock. This makes it so much more accessible to the broader community community and hopefully increases the support to achieve this very important goal.
dsDT2ImF,"I’m so glad to hear of the pivot from building the new aquatic center in Port Townsend, to the much more central location of Port Hadlock!    I think it will better serve jeffco residents as a whole and provide the much underserved community of working class families a well deserved outlet to community engagement, opportunity and accessibility close to home."
rMCifGl5,"I am unlikely to use an aquatic facility much, however, I think it could be an important facility for the community in many ways."
UFCYmCct,This would be an amazing resource!!!
mFB6ACJS,Would love the pools to be non-chlorinated!
OrCYEmWQ,"We need a “build a pool, Save a life’ campaign like they had in PA when they got their pool up and running. Or at least something to oppose the ‘no pool tax’ signs.   I would love it if we had something very similar to the PA pool. It’s so nice there, but I hate driving so far to go. People of all ages would benefit from this resource!"
uCCKMGR4,"Locating the pool in mid-county is an essential part of making this a reality, not because I live here, but because the overwhelming majority of county residents that are below median household income live outside of port townsend. Cost of transportation and overall accessibility must be a huge focus when considering who will most be able to access the pool/athletic facilities. Thank you for this survey!"
lWB6Qya1,The location next to the Tri-Area Community Center is a better location than the one next to the library because of parking issues.  Parking is a huge issue at current pool.  Nest to library is also going into a more crowded and residential area.
LdCKMv7o,I am so excited for this facility! It is very needed and my family will use it a ton and be so grateful. Happy to pay the tax because it is important!!!
jWCKlINw,"Even though I live next to Mountian View Pool, I support the more equitable placement of the pool in Port Hadlock. I want more access and investment in all of Jefferson County!"
PyB64Msw,"Some people have commented that we don’t need a pool because we’re surrounded by water.  It’s BECAUSE we’re surrounded by water that we need a pool!  I wonder how many people are out there in boats/paddleboards/kayaks etc. that don’t know how to swim - INCLUDING the school groups that the maritime center instructs!  Kids -and adults - cannot learn to swim in 50 (or less) degree water.  I suspect most of the people that are against a pool don’t know how to swim, or are uncomfortable in water. Access to a pool could change that.   It doesn’t need to be an elaborate facility - we don’t need a water park - just a well thought out pool with 6 lanes that could be used for everything from recreational swims/lessons/swim team/water aerobics…. All this can be accomplished with a well thought out schedule.  FAR more people will use a pool than a golf course,( which seems to have the most attention these days).  I’ve never seen kids on that golf course, and golf will not save your life.  The golf course is already there. Leave it alone and let’s get a pool for the masses that WILL use it!  If you build it, they will come."
rRCYTSqQ,I appreciate the centralized location. I live very near Mountain View and I only go about once a year because it just isn’t very enjoyable. I do think it should be as easily accessible to all county residents as is reasonable and this is a good location. Good hard thought and input will be needed to ensure we get a facility that is attractive without being a “Taj Mahal” pool. The regressive sales tax option is problematic but that’s a function of a large statewide systemic problem. I suspect two-tenths of a cent will be more palatable to more voters than a property tax assessment. I think another overlooked aspect of having this pool and having it where it would be is further building the connections between Port Townsend and Chimacum/Quilcene students.
IgknyyD0,As a regular swimmer I do see the pool to be used for a lot of people for health purposes and wellbeing!
A8ktJEyD,"While this is not a facility I would likely use, I understand the community need for a place for kids to learn to swim and some recreation.  There are many who oppose a tax, and I have wondered if a non profit where people who want to use it could pay a periodic membership and/or benevolently donate might work?"
kyko6WZI,"Fitness center, cardio and weights"
hmCiJwbG,We need a therapy pool that is warmer than current swimming pool. I would have been a regular user for years if there were a pool that was warmer.  My muscles cramp in cold water.
dOEBnplJ,"I hope there will be programs and open use time during evening and early morning hours, to make it available for people who have full time jobs."
ulCijwzF,"We need to know just what is being proposed.  I would vote for a simple pool and locker room, but not something more extensive than that.  There are some very poor people in this county who just cannot afford more taxes.  How about a local income tax for people (like me) who could afford it."
V2CKGTEN,Thank you! We sincerely need this center!
FgCYaZcX,I am an enthusiastic supporter for the new Aquatic Facility for Jefferson county!  Thank you for location selection.
EYEBPgMh,"Allow independent, private developers to bid on and build aquatic centers, housing developments, stores, restaurants, hotels, golf courses, everything. The development restrictions in Jefferson County are absurd and will lead to long lasting inequality and infrastructural decay. This pool is never going to happen unless it is built by a private developer. I can also say that there is absolutely no way I will vote for this to be tax payer funded at any level. I would however rejoice in private development of any kind in Jeffco."
9qC41Q6t,"If includes a climbing gym, we’d use nearly every day"
eaB6DRd0,Thank you for asking these questions. My children and grandchildren really need to have a community place like.this.
0UCKskND,I think it’s a great idea to have it located in the county rather than in PT city limits.  I would definitely take water aerobics & swim laps. Thank you.
7eEBbCHV,"I love the idea of a pool/recreation facility located in Port Hadlock near the library and elementary school. Though I do not have kids myself, so I answered no too many of the questions about childcare, I think it is extremely important to provide childcare and youth education opportunities. I am a farm worker so I would absolutely love to have access to a sauna, therapeutic opportunities, and lap, swimming. The idea of community spaces, community kitchen and shower facilities is also really important for our community and exciting! I personally have so much excitement about the climbing/boulder gym idea. Bring climbing to Jefferson County!! Bouldering or ropes I would definitely use frequently and know many people who would be excited about this. While I am supportive of a sales tax to fund this project, I wonder if there is a tax that can be focused on people with the higher incomes to fund it as well."
n0CicpWz,I have never used the one we have nor do I plan to use a new one. I do wholeheartedly support a new pool center
gfDT7hKK,"This county is divided into three segments the rich the poor and the elderly. The current pool in PT mostly caters to the old who have time in the morning or afternoon to use the facilities. The youth have almost been completely eliminated  from using pool cause of limited hours of operation. Also young families with infant or toddlers can’t access the pool after working hours cause of staffing shortages. I personally don’t give two shits if the pool gets built if my kid doesn’t  get the opportunity to use it, after we the working class get off of work.  With that being said I would tread lightly with the idea of building a giant aquatic center. Not everybody in this community is rich and our a trust fund baby, many of us are working class and with the rising cost of amenities food and future county and PT road tax not to mention the 2019 IDD levy that was passed. Pockets aren’t as deep as they once were."
FoCKHHhD,"I'm so excited about this potential pool and center! I hope this happens!!! My husband and I are planning to be foster caregivers, and so this space will be especially useful for us!"
nNEB9UUG,In reality I would rather see aging infrastructure repaired such as the sewer pipes in PT and aging waterlines from the reservoir before starting a project like this. But I support what the majority chooses
2MCiqNDG,"Having access to showers and a gym for lifting weights and cardio would be absolutely amazing. I would also love to participate in dance classes for adults! This would be an amazing resource and even though I don’t have kids and only answered for myself, my friends have had a horrible time trying to access affordable childcare that takes state vouchers. It would be awesome if those kinds of programs were part of the facility r adjacent to them."
JjkER0J7,"It appears someone wants a new aquatic facility just not south county. Why force it on people just carve out south of the 104. Have that portion of the population that what use of the facility, pay a higher out of district fee."
BkB6XVZv,"Two pools is critical. One warm for water walking and therapy and one cool for lap swimming. The current pool is too cold for one group and too hot for the other and no one is happy. I currently think it is WAY to warm and find it deeply off-putting, but know the opposite is true for water walkers."
lSB675rh,"I would have liked to have seen a ""once a month"" option on the how often would you use the facility.  I do support the idea of this center in Chimacum. I especially like the idea of it being configured for more uses along with the pool."
CvCYX7CS,If there was a bouldering wall I would go there all the time!!!! What an amazing opportunity to pair up another type of recreation that is not currently available in Jeffco
GzCKid05,This is much needed! Hope it happens soon
gACij8lP,"I would love to have an aquatic space that works for lots of people the community. While I do not have children, I do want them to have a safe multipurpose space. I love the idea of having things other than water activities. I can imagine myself Going there weekly and if it’s a great space, I could potentially use it more."
rsDTniUK,I would like this center to be designed especially for young people.  There aren't enough healthy activities for them in Jefferson county.
dxCizwqv,Don't make it cheap and shitty.
1mfUgd7E,I’m so excited this is being planned for port hadlock! We need more community resources like this south of PT.
Sfk5Wd6C,Need to have family  Membership
qBC4tZdH,"Often I go to the rec center in Victoria BC when I visit family and one thing I’ve noticed is that their hours are very extensive. I think that is a huge important factor in this aquatic center, making income and being able to sustain itself as of right now, the swimming in the area we have closes at four or five or sometimes six and so working class families are not able to use it. During the week. They have gyms that are open till nine in multiple rooms. They have wonderful amenities. They do farmers markets in the winter inside. They hold events for Christmas markets. You can rent out rooms for birthday parties. They offer safe Havens for people to get out of the elements and to move their bodies. It’s wonderful to see old and Young altogether in a community. I am very excited that this might possibly happen in Port Hadlock. I think this community would greatly benefit from having such a facility for families and multigenerational folks to use. As well as add to a small employment pool."
SzB6gkZt,An aquatic facility  in East Jefferson County is essential for the future of our community.
pfEBs6qq,Our family is very interested and supportive  of a centrally located Aquatic/Activity Center in the Port Hadlock/Chimacum area. We would use it often. We would not support a levy or tax increase (and would vote against) if the proposed Center was placed in the City of Port Townsend.
8SB6tirt,I would implore whomever is designing the center to use saline instead of the toxic amount of chorine currently being used in mountain view pool.
VxCKGM65,I would support the tax for a climbing gym but don’t think there is anything so wrong with the Mountain View pool.
Jzk1aF5F,I don’t think I would use but I think this is vital for the health of our community and supports families. I’m so excited of the talk to move to Port Hadlock
8iEBuPxc,"We have a duty to provide swimming education to our children, who are surrounded by sea water.  We need a public pool.  Since it looks like we need to start fresh, we should assure that the pool will meet the specifications for swimming competitions so our school kids can compete locally and host tournements here.  We also need therapeutic access for injured and elderly people.  I never get into a swimsuit if I can help it, but that is irrelevant to me.  Obviously we need a public pool in our county.  Thanks for your efforts."
Jtk87pIC,NO
7BC4s2iz,Build a pool and drop this mega facility nonsense. Nice physical move in the right direction but would be better suited closer to marginalized county members
EiC4azUO,It is important for younger folks.
huCYmCLQ,We would LOVE to have a pool with some of these proposed offerings!!
QvCYXv9R,"Port Ludlow clubs meet our needs and then some. We would be very unlikely to make use of the proposed Aquatic Center. That said we might vote for the tax nonetheless if it is clear who will benefit - school kids especially. It would be very helpful if Commissioner Brotherton and the Task Force stopped presenting this as if it's a done deal - all that does is inflame opposition. And, please, no more ridiculous arguments like it will be a tourist attraction. Finally, don't dig into funds dedicated to other purposes - like the Lodging Tax. If it is so highly supported then the champions need to raise the $160000 (or whatever) to start the PDF and get the tax on the ballot!"
E3B6mqTU,"As a parent and resident of Quilcene it is very exciting to hear of this. We need this so badly, Port Townsend ymca is just too far for accessible weekly use. However I worry about adding more sales tax. I’d love to see some more progressive ideas around funding that doesn’t land so hard on families that are already struggling to stay in the area and small businesses struggling to stay open. Homes and second homes valued at over million? Local private land owners sitting on investment property? Got a yacht? What a great way for the wealthy to give back to our community. I’m hoping this to be thought about more equitably. Thanks!"
vSEBovX6,I am so just excited about this possibility with a family of 4. We don't like to drive all the way to Port Angeles for a good pool appropriate for our 5 and 2 year old...
lzf9hc4c,Very excited for this!!! Really hopeful it will be Salt water.
foC4GEiX,"This is a need, not a want. We need places for our children and teens to gather and have activities to do in the Hadlock area. I use the current pool 3 to 4 times a week. I would love for the facility to have a gym that I could access with my membership."
n4CYiFXH,Thank you!
mkB6agZ1,Very excited about h to e prospect of having a new aquatic and recreation facility in Port Hadlock!
USB6F2zU,"Need INDOOR REC AREA...games rooms...chess, board games, cards. Basketball, Fitness equipment, creative dance, individual and group activity equipment. An indoor space for exercise and socialization for the grey rainy days.  NO POOL==MAINTENANCE IS $$$$.  The pool narrows the usage to a select few.  An large indoor rec center will utilize a far larger % of our population. Much cheaper maintenance and probably even safer."
6lB6zX19,No to your pool
71Ciz6xn,Salt water/non chlorine pool please! Will likely not use if chlorine
6bB6t1cd,"The pool is important for our youth. Kids need a facility in order to compete in aquatic sports and for recreational activities. Kids need to learn to swim, families need time together doing healthy sports, and anyone may need a therapeutic pool at some time in their life."
rlCiZzxV,I’d love if there was a cafe and family oriented indoor space. Even a an arcade and roller rink would be amazing. At the very least a kid-friendly pool with a lazy river.
ZnC4HTGg,I would use the pool more if it was in PT
zeky2m0N,Stop the insanity of taxing everyone out of their homes
XOC4shhC,We can’t wait to enjoy this important addition to our community!
wBCidD1t,"Need more specific info on sales tax funding!   The more INDOOR recreation space the better because of our unpredictable weather.   Gym space for adult and kid rec leagues!! Basketball and volleyball, etc."
kYCKqRWG,"This seems exciting and could be really useful for the community, especially considering how many families live in Hadlock, Chimacum and Quilcene. My family would be most interested in swimming in a local pool that is a saltwater pool, I don’t think we would visit frequently if it was just straight chlorine. Many local families would likely agree. Sauna/steam room would be lovely. I love the idea of some sort of outside splash park area for children."
dvC4X6tf,I very much support the building of an aquatic center and am enthusiastic about the proposed location.
7qkpM1J4,I prefer a saltwater pool
I4C4Cypb,Build it…ASAP!
2hC4eAeO,Many more urgent needs for residents.
MdfxLidM,"Although I don't have Young children, I support activities for children very strongly!"
8zC4j9d4,Glad a Hadlock/Chimacum location is being considered.
4iCinxqC,"I don’t have children yet, but having a facility the provides services for children/ childcare and ongoing youth programs is important to me."
TdfWmyRQ,"I support many taxes to benefit other residents, but I feel that an aquatic center should be funded and supported by the people who want and will use it."
dWCiSMlD,Hadlock is the perfect place for such a regional treasure. Kids and adults alike need community minded exercise options. Kids aren’t learning how to swim now and it causes danger in many outdoor situations.
5Tf9nD0m,Our family would definitely use an indoor pool for water aerobics if it were in Port Townsend. The location seems too far away from the main population center. I doubt we would drive to that location for a pool unless we needed it for physical therapy and there was no closer option.
HzC4iW6p,I think that it is imperative that we have an excellent and versatile aquatic center in East Jefferson County and would be willing to support it with additional donations.
KrB6Mtdo,Port Hadlock is an ideal location for a county facility. Please plan for a sufficiently sized parking lot. Multi-use spaces in addition to pools would be wonderful.
gzCKnGhn,I miss having a pool to use for lap swimming and if we had easy access to one I would use it several times a week.
SSDTtuHB,"If pickleball facilities were added I would use it often. Especially if it was a covered court. No Pickleball then I don’t support a new pool. Please put this tax on groceries and prescriptions. If it’s going to be used for physical therapy then the healthcare professionals need to be helping fund this. If they do t help, then no access to the facilities."
FPEBsQvP,"We go to the Mtn View pool frequently with our seven year old who also took swim lessons there. We wish there was more opportunity for swim lessons and other programs for youth and adult. Our child is also interested in competitive swimming eventually. As our household has two former lifeguards, a serious swimmer and a pool loving kid, we would be very excited and supportive of a new pool. We would happily travel from PT to Port Hadlock for it. In addition my local father in law is a dedicated (daily in the summer in local lakes) swimmer and would use this pool extensively as well.   Having a good community pool is so important to our county. We live surrounded by the ocean and teaching all of our children to swim and general water safety is incredibly important for safety. Thank you!"
Q8CKjPvP,the youth of the county deserve a place to go as well as swim team.  The county has never had any facility to use.  The Port Ludlowites  have their private facilities.  Why would only county residents be responsible for tax to pay for this.  It is  time that county people stop driving into PT for everything
xuC4Sv3V,We love the idea of a pool in our area. I think it makes a lot of sense having it centrally located in Port Hadlock-Irondale. This area has the potential to grow significantly with the sewer system and Habitat for Humanity housing development. I appreciate you considering the needs of young families such as ours as well as the other young families who will soon have affordable housing and not forced to move away like many of our friends have.
EFCYMxfN,"Our beautiful county is surrounded by water and it is very important to me that my children (and all Jeff Co children) learn to swim. Currently we drive 45 mins to sequim for swim lessons, which is interruptive to our family’s busy schedule. We are so grateful and excited that this facility will be coming to Port Hadlock!"
ypB6mn9P,Keep up the good work. We desperately need this
ReDTLdjC,"Water slides and splash/play features have always been a big hit with my family, and I love the idea of a rock climbing/bouldering gym.  Another thing to consider would be a community resource for camping/gear/outdoor rental facility offering equipment and information to help people access the wilderness around us."
InB6oMU7,Don’t try to have everything or it won’t get built. Just build a swimming pool.
qUEBxpPf,"No more taxes Start go fund for pool, gladly donate but no new taxes."
uvCKoFwn,Port Townsend hasn’t proven itself capable of operating a large venue such as this project. Just look at what has happened to Fort Worden in the last few years and no one on city council has ever run a successful business that I am aware of. You think the golf course was gushing money. Just wait until you put in a pool. The only way I see it working is if the pool and the facilities are turned. Over to the YMCA.
ckfcDpcz,It would be amazing!!! I would probably go a lot with my nieces and nephew too.
GFf45a1K,Need this for health and wellness of community and to attract families to the area.  If we aren’t a growing community we are a dying community.  We need to support growth!
qOf0Y0sK,Thanks for all your hard work thus far. Good luck!!
FJDTahBE,"An aquatic community center is important for health, families, community connection and safely learning to swim."
t1DTgZxv,used the pool daily when younger.we support uses for younger people -my daughter used the pool daily as a teenager. healthy place for younger folks to go and recreate
zSfYIe4B,"Please make it a beautiful community center where teens feel welcome and their swimming trophies can be displayed.  Please go visit the library in Winthrop, and you can see the fireplace, the low shelving and the big windows.  Think about design!"
tCCYU4zg,Build it.
C8C4eYYk,"It seems foolhardy to build this facility outside the major population center of Jefferson County. This location risks building a facility that will be underutilized. It will be all but inaccessible to children in lower-income households in PT. It also guarantees increased road traffic and continued dependence on single occupancy vehicles, together with accompanying air pollution and collisions. Please consider a site in or near PT that would mitigate the many downsides of this suburban location."
9UkWCqta,I would be much more likely to use the pool if it was in port townsend and not in port hadlock.
x1B6yD68,Why not a HEATED outdoor pool open in the summer? Why unheated? Sounds crazy at this latitude.
XQB6RIgP,"I question the location choice.  It seems to be based average driving distance based on anywhere in the county, rather than average commute time for each county resident.  More than half of the population lives within 5 miles of port townsend.  There are more commute options for a larger segment of the population as well.  Biking, walking, more public transportation, driving shorter distance.  Also adds less congestion to the one road in and out of town.  Your question ...would you support an aquatic center was tied to the comment that you plan to locate it in port hadlock.  You may have received more useful data had you separated out those questions.   Do you support an aquatic center.  Separate from a question listing location options."
GUCKIqzL,Better location than PT. Thx for that.
y9CKaU9a,"West Jefferson Co. residents should pay NOTHING for a pool they’ll never use; bulk of cost should be swimmer’s & next East Jeffco dwellers contribution to ensure local kids can swim, a safety factor. If fru-fru is included in development, all $$ should come from facility users. Do not ask working families with no or very little call for hot tubs & yuppie coffee to contribute to the wealthy’s country club! Don’t be a Trump!"
uyCiilYW,"The pool is the most important thing, not all the add ons like group fitness, coffee bar, pickle ball (we have a lot of pickle ball courts alread, imho) and it shouldn't compete with other existing businesses like the athletic clubs. That is one thing that created a lot of opposition the first time this came up."
TzC4DTXJ,My Mother was very involved with the building of the Bainbridge pool.  She and the other parkboard members traveled to many different communities and looked at pools.  They decided after years (It took years and many times voted down by the public our family voted no until the last year.) They went the route they did because they found all the extras would attract the off visitors to come and help pay for the rest of the pool.  I am pretty sure it worked.  But we are a different area and there are already fancy pools close.  So I think if a pool is built here a know frills pool is best and remembering that many of us live here to be without the frills and gimmicks of other places.  I would rather my tax money be spent on the purchase of a swim beach park in Quilcene but can see the benefit of a pool and would probably take my littlest to swim lessons once in her life.  Who knows maybe when I am an old lady I would go swim some laps at 6am twice a week.  Thanks for listening.
sSC4Zerr,Public transportation to the facility is important. Most of the people using the facility will come from Port Townsend as that has the greatest population. Offering transportation will be important to many
2ZkDAnk8,bouldering / rock climbing gym please
RKB6Jjqw,"I’m surprised that the commissioners did not consider the findings submitted by a robust volunteer council that did intensive research to select the new location.  Additionally, while I’m interested in the idea of a community recreation center, it disturbs me that funding overlooks the terrible cost of living crisis and houselessness & housing instability so prevalent in the county. Additionally, south and west country receives absolutely nothing and it feels like a kick in the teeth to tax them for a community center that is not accessible to them when they have barely any county support where they’re at; Brinnon doesn’t even have a clinic. I’m not opposed to a rec center by any means but the priorities of the local officials are deeply disturbing."
U1fXiiHV,We believe this would be a good asset to the community and support child care through this facility.
fMkRJXkR,I like the new site that is more centrally accessible for Jefferson county and close to schools and the library for youth and kids. I don't use the pool because I can't handle chlorine but I am more than willing to support the facility for our youth and kids especially.
pLB6Omp1,"I think it is important to offer these kinds of amenities to the community as a whole.  If we want families to live here, we need to provide appealing facilities."
REkRBmgP,Have lost all confidence in pool management by YMCA. THEY SEEM MORE INTERESTED IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING THAN serving the needs of the community.
UqC4b4EA,"I'd keep the aquatic and rec facility on the small side. I was at the Pinedale,WY Aquatic Center. https://www.pinedaleaquatic.com/ It was amazing, paid by oil money. Now that the money isn't flowing, they're in trouble."
ZaDTxN11,"I will only support it being built at Chimacum Park, not next to the primary school by the 70 units of housing being built. Next to Chimacum Primary might seem like a good location because all those new units have easy access but it is not a good location for the rest of us.  We would even prefer keeping the current site in Port Townsend over the location next to the primary school. Additionally, Chimacum Park (next to the High School) would be very convenient for High School programs.  We need to support families more and not just the elderly. We need it by the high school!"
mUCKGcfA,Please make the pool salt water and use as limited chemicals as possible. I will not be able to use the facilities if they were heavily chemical.
2PEBPdv5,"Locating in Hadlock is an accessibility game changer for S County, fully support this facility"
JpfUe1Rh,Our family has wished for a pool nearby for many years.
6kfF9U6Y,Please make it Saltwater! I would be more inclined to swim. I would be interested if there has been a survey at the Mountain View Pool to determine what the average commuter distance is for swimmers attending. Of course I would prefer to have it in PT a closer commute for me.
YcB6v7s2,I think funding for the effort should not be a burden on county residents who do not use the pool or use taxes/revenue that could be spent on efforts of more widespread value to the community than a costly pool.  The BOCC needs to abandon the overly zealous support of this effort
8hCYysFd,"I am an ex-lifeguard and certified Water Safety Instructor. I don't swim regularly but I believe that teaching swimming to every child is very important, especially since we are practically surrounded by dangerous waters."
vxDTCkuh,Deep water aerobic later than 7:30 a m.
Xzk7LVZP,The new pool should be a standard 25m or 50m.
ppB6peue,Port Hadlock is a better choice than Port Townsend but I am concerned about low income residents in Qulicene and Brinnon paying for a facility that would be a long drive and for whom the facility would likely not be of much value.
HTEBJH2o,It is a fair drive from PT and I wouldn't use it.
j6DTE9gi,I'm very supportive of this effort and would make good use of a new facility. Right now we're driving to Sequim or Silverdale once or twice a week to swim because the hours at Mountain View don't work for us.  It would also be great to have a space for other classes like yoga or Pilates & community gatherings. Thank you for your efforts!
fTky78p4,"I would like to have a gym with cardio equipment like an eliptical and treadmill,  and a weight lifting area like the YMCA facility in Sequim.  Although we no longer have youth or young children,  we fully support providing competition swimming capacity and all levels of childhood opportunities related to fitness."
0mB6XOB1,We don’t want to raise our taxes to pay for a pool in PT!!!!!
rxEBCb5D,I would need to see the final numbers on the cost of the facility before I commit to saying yes to a tax increase.
SkDTAHdk,"My bottom line...can we afford this? Many people cannot afford increased taxes, cost of membership, price per swim, etc. I feel that people outside of Port Townsend city limits have an increased SAY and not let PT older residents who can afford this to sway the outcome.  Kids need swim lessons...perhaps basic facility would be best long run. Do we really need all the items on the wishlist!!! Also....expand the efforts of people in the county to take part in a survey. Not everyone stays on top of local news via digital access including email newsletters. Go BIG in availability via all churches, food banks, community centers, survey takers at grocery stores/Jefferson Healthcare clinic, etc. This is completely important...not to leave anyone out."
LrCiueNd,Jefferson County is large and mostly pretty rural. It takes more than two hours to Port Hadlock from some places. This facility is not likely to draw users from very far. It seems to me that residents who will get little or no benefit are being asked to pay for it on a county level. Let incorporated areas close to it who wish to have its benefit pay for it through their property taxes.
BeDTBJyb,I hope it happens before I croak.
gRkw2xG7,Building in Port Hadlock is much better than Port Townsend
XJB6oOJq,"I am happy to hear it would be in Hadlock instead of port townsend, seems like it would get a lot of use"
8pB6Ogls,I am also in support of providing diversity to communities who might not swim access to adult swim classes for BIPOC community adults. As an aquatic bodywork practitioner I would be interested in renting the therapy  pool to see clients one day a week. I am a pool user and love to swim workout be in water  for exercise and relaxation this is very important to me and my family.
IQCiw8TM,Let's do it!
qoB6PSig,The facility needs to have private areas like locker rooms and bathrooms that can accommodate all users and prevent confrontations like the one the YMCA has recently been involved in.
0RDTMWEE,Good luck! :)
SEC4MzL6,Explain more why the current swimming pool in Port Townsend is not adequate
nHCKCcDf,pro kids in jeff co!
wWCipRAI,This idea is not sustainable and by design will be running at a deficit. It excludes the poorest residents of the county by design.  I would prefer multiple small facilities distributed around the county to address the diverse needs of the county.
OyC4GWTS,I would like to see increased bus or van service to south county. Currently you can catch the bus early in the morning then late in the evening if you cannot drive yourself. Increasing the trips made between Brinnon/Quilcene and Port Townsend would generally increase the number of times I visit Port Townsend and spend money there. It shouldn't require an entire day of staying in P.T. just to take advantage of public transportation.
0pCYHcJt,I would hope it’s location would coincide with a bus route and or a new bus stop.  While I don’t usually use the bus it’s be neat if it lined up easily for tween/teens to get to from PT.
lIDTyrBg,Keep it simple…just a pool.  As inexpensive to build and maintain as possible.
v0CigBqZ,Fix the pool in Port Townsend before proposing a new pool elsewhere!
hnCKEtKZ,"It is very needed  It my youth. The pool gave me something to do to keep me out of trouble. It also gave me a sport that was low impact, was good for nearly every muscle in my body . It was also a team & an individual sport . I can still swim in my senior years to stay fit.   It’s also great in the winter months when it’s dark and cold outside.  I would be happy to volunteer in the winter as a life guard or to give swim lessons if needed"
33B6z0yN,"Jefferson County has many pressing issues to address, and a pool should be the lowest priority. With the cost of goods already unaffordable, adding more sales taxes for a project with limited public benefit is not the right approach."
CLCi4Jn3,"My concern is that there is not information, at least not easily accessible to the public that shows any thorough planning on the longevity of maintaining a new pool.  I feel that applying more financial burden in a county that already has a relatively high sales tax will only make life harder for lower income residents. While I can understand the community benefit of a pool space I do not believe this these will outweigh the  negative impact on our local economy. If the pool space generates income to the county, I do not believe it will flow back toward the lower income residents who will be sacrificing more intrinsically for the space.  What is the point in adding a resource if it will put the highest burden on those who lack resources? It seems to cater to the wealthy, rather than the community.  Ultimately, my decision to vote NO against the pool tax is a lack of information that will allow me to trust that the pool space will be properly maintained, managed, utilized or any assurance that in any unforeseen case of closure that the new space will continue to be utilized.  I see very little forethought represented aside from how much it will cost, it seems like a silly idea to me without information that shows a plan beyond building.  More information about how the space will be managed and taken care of needs to be provided to the public."
lWDT8HHK,More than myself I know that childhood swimming lessons are extremely important and am very glad i had a community pool when i was young to take swimming lessons. The benefits have lasted me the rest of my life.
fhfRcWdf,DON'T Build a facility...we can't financially support it or it's debt
hPCYLZC9,"I am glad to see this project is moving along. I hope to see a beautiful, well-designed, inviting space with multiple opportunities for people. The central location is essential and welcome."
UsDT9Zna,"1. Don't use the Port Townsend YMCA to run it.   2. Offer just a pool, not a place to have a sauna, fitness class, rock climbing, teen center.  Some of those offerings are reminders of the PT pool mess that was going to be everything to everyone including competing with yoga teachers, gyms, etc."
COC41co1,small outside park with BBQ grills  swim lanes with starting blocks for teams
WPB6fGWn,I have a pool why would I need another.
tmCiCEsD,"Check out ""watermania"" outside of vancouver BC.  The wave pool is a showstopper for kids and families.  The steam room, sauna, and hot tub makes it an amazing family and community center too.  $5 CA entry fee. God bless Canada.  I don't care about a lap pool."
RnDTre8a,Funding for a new aquatic center should be from usage fees (pay per visit or membership fees) and donations.  Every voter who wants it can donate the amount they would have been taxed.
iiCK7UZT,Please consider construction of a saltwater pool rather than a chlorinated one.
SBk74yjt,"Pleased about central location. Even though my use would be limited, i see the value for the community. Concerned, though... With present federal chaos, that there is small chance of  grants to subsidize the cost. The details and scope of planned pool facility will reveal the actual possibilty of this small tax base being able to afford the cost."
vJfodF6t,Port Hadlock is not the heart of Jefferson county.  This pool will only be used by Port Townsend majority. Port Townsend needs to fund not county
3vC4ynP7,I never used the pool because I never felt welcome there. I appreciate the outreach and hope this pool is accessible to and welcoming of the diverse backgrounds in our community that are often left out
0ykMyCQO,This is less important than fixing the many many significantly-less-than-acceptable roads in Port Townsend
OZCY65XV,"I don't use the Mountain View pool because the acoustics are poor in the building so that it's very loud and unnerving, also there is too much chlorine in the pool and it hurts my eyes, and the dressing rooms have very little privacy. If those things were addressed in the planning and construction of this aquatic center, I would love to use it because I love to swim. When I lived in Port Ludlow, I frequently visited that pool."
4CkeAF6i,Good luck with getting it built and opened! We need a new facility.
8KCK1Bmb,"I love our pool!  Only drawback is the schedule and limited hours. More hours andmore classes, in and out of the water, would be great!!"
s3fzFAc6,Highly in favor of a new facility and need the water aerobics for my 4 artificial joints!! Thanks for all your efforts!
bWf2UWfS,"I have no interest in an aquatic center unless it is highly affordable/subsidized.  If people can't afford to enjoy the pool and bring their kids/family members than there is no point in building a center only the wealthy can use.  Drop in fees should be $5, Punch Pass for 24 visits should be $48, and an annual pass should be $300.  This follows Petersburg, AK parks and rec fee structure for pool, sauna, gym, and shower access."
0aC4NxcB,"Would love to see a “Grandkids/Grandma &Grandpa” monthly event, or more often; Events like this as it brings community, fun, bonding and families together."
lVCif2hp,I would love it if a pool was built in port hadlock!!!
h5CYyv2E,"I don’t have children but would support the tax for an aquatic center for kids and teens too, whether in Port Hadlock or Port Townsend. Though, personally, I would use it more in Port Hadlock, it seems most people are in Port Townsend so perhaps it should be there instead."
ZSB62YWO,"If you built it and tax us anymore for un  needed buildings, that you have a hard time running , or paying for , I own rentals and just have raise rent , so high you won't be able to staff your building, stop wasting everyone hard earned money"
LKCKXzx1,Pools are important for all ages and all communities. I really hope that this new facility is built soon! It will be a huge asset for Jefferson County and a wonderful way to promote health!
2yDTCuAV,"The development and ongoing maintenance of an aquatic facility - or even just a swimming pool - is FOLLY for a county of just 33-34,000 residents whose median income is less than $36k.  Please do the research in a responsible way!  Is there ANY municipality (city or county) that has been able to support construction and ongoing maintenance of a pool or an aquatic facility with fewer than 35,000 residents?    As we know, grants are less and less reliable, and need to be understood as ""one time revenue"".  Continuous revenue like a sales tax paid by fewer than 16,000 households will never be sufficient to cover the perpetual cost of an aquatic facility - no matter how much in user fee income can be collected from those who say they are likely users.    Swimming and water exercise are not the only way to achieve individual rehabilitation and wellness goals, although they are arguably THE MOST EXPENSIVE way.    Think again . . . and think of the WHOLE COUNTY before placing another burden on families who must supply their children with clothing, school supplies, and dozens of necessities that already carry a 9.1% to 9.4% sales tax.    This aquatic center proposal represents not only a failure of financial acuity, but an affront to residents whose household finances are already beyond manageable.  Let's take one little step in the direction of empathy and compassion -- drop this project and redirect the construction funds to something Jefferson County REALLY needs.  Like affordable housing."
oFCYYxxy,Personally I would love to see more diversity in the facility and curate a therapeutic pool space for aquatic bodywork in our area 
qRCiV7l0,Go for it!
AKfcXK8h,"Just a pool, showers, sauna for young people and adults. Do not propose a sports or recreation center which makes passing a bond issue very difficult."
0aCKYCLM,"Whiile I feel there are uses by specific age groups for the pool area, I don't think many of the proposed added sports/meeting areas are warranted.  I, for one, can not continue to pay increased taxes on property, food, supplies, etc. How many people will lose their homes, those people living on the edge of poverty right now? With just the increase price of food, we continue to cut back, soon the basics will be out of our reach. Gas prices continue to go up so we couldn't even afford to drive there!!  Find some other funding and leave the taxes increase out of the picture!!"
SOC4zTzZ,Even though I am unlikely to utilize the facility I support a community that engages those that enjoy the activities described and would support financially through taxation. I'm particularly glad that it is being located in Port Hadlock as a halfway place for our county.
26C4gVQh,"Since I live in Brinnon there is no way I support a tax for a facility too far away for easy access.  And anything I noted that might be used (like after school programs ) would only be used if transportation to/from was provided.  TLDR  summary...too far, too expensive"
o0fWWPFN,An important effort for East Jefferson County. Thank you
rvC4oGoB,I support the building of the aquatic center although I may not use it very much. Thank you.
DBEBf0x7,Thank you for this survey and I hope to see this vision come to life!
iufymiKK,No pool tax! We struggle to make ends meet as it is. Taxes should not be for used for amenities like this. We need adequate housing for our young workers and their families. So many times employers struggle to attract workers because housing is too expensive. A fancy pool does nothing to resolve that issue and may exacerbate the problem by increasing property taxes.
FrB68kwt,I love the idea of a basketball court and a rock climbing/bouldering area. Very exciting!
mQCK6XWh,"Rather than spend our tax dollars on such a facility, I’d prefer to see more tiny home villages built for the homeless so the folks in need can have a good shelter and be able to re-engage in the workforce."
sTC4y3ZF,It might be nice to take our grandchildren there when they come to visit.
7UC4as37,"It isn’t that we don’t think pools are good, it is just that our small county cannot afford such a luxury.  It can’t even afford the ongoing maintenance of a pool facility.      The wealth concentrated in Port Townsend can afford such a luxury.  The residents of the rural county are not affluent but generally cash-strapped, making ends meet.  You need to survey the rural population to see how they feel about this—this survey on a website probably isn’t accessible to the general resident who is too busy getting on with his life.  What we are hearing from friends and neighbors is resoundingly NO to the pool.    It’s asking too much of the whole county.  If Port Townsend wants a pool, and they are really the users, they should build a city pool and pay for it with city funds.  We don’t even have basic utilities here—public water, sewer, etc.  A pool is beyond luxury.  We say NO county pool, no increased taxes.  Money should be spent on something more basic like affordable housing."
cPDTFh0r,"I like the idea. If there's room for more facilities, I think having a gym/workout area would be nice. A sauna and hot tub would be very popular."
wACi6I6u,"If we are considering this Port Hadlock facility because of the assumption that more rural county voters would not support an in town facility, why do we think the more numerous in town voters would support a facility that is out in the county? I generally support all votes for taxes for improved services and I am really doubting if I will approve this if it goes to a vote. Yes I want everyone to have access to facilities, but why would we build one far away from the population center? Why would we build where there is not a sewer system? This survey did not really offer ideas like how would children access after school programs. There are significantly more children that attend school in Port Townsend. Would PT Public School students lose access to free swim lessons in school? The facility in Hadlock brings up more questions that it solves."
dyDTQr1i,We love that the Shore pool is saltwater instead of chlorine. Our family would use the pool more often if it was saltwater. A splash pad sounds amazing but would be even better if that part was free.
0dB6q1vJ,I’m thrilled that this might happen! It would be incredible to have a larger pool that accommodates more needs and accessibility.
hcEBXWii,Very important for the youth!
JjCKdak8,What's the plan for maintenance costs?  Money could be better spent elsewhere- i.e. housing.  Taxes in PT are already too high.
JFCKFauj,can't afford this taxes are already unaffordable
XIC4kgxv,"I am not a swimmer, but my wife is an avid swimmer. I would use the new facility if it had other uses or perhaps for water related exercise programs. My greatest concern is staffing. My wife has given up on Mountain View because of wildly irregular hours due to lack of staff. It would need regular, consistent hours including early and late hours for those of us that work. If this cannot be addressed, I would oppose a new facility."
DnCYBGat,"We are retired, can barely afford to hold on to our home of 40 years. The county now wants an additional tax for roads, and presently Washington State wants to pass an increase in property tax. PUD costs us so much I go out and shut off opener to our home 7 hours a day. Our son is a shipwright in town, and is presently re-training as a machinist in order to apply for work with BNSF in Wyoming where they could then afford to buy a home because it is impossible to buy a home here on a blue collar wage. Jefferson County is turning into Aspen Colorado where the working man and young families work but cannot live. NO TAX For A POOL!"
9xB6PwqY,"We need this in our community! We will not use the pool for swim lessons, but I feel it is vitally important for people to know how to swim. Also, personally, my husband I I would be very happy to have good fitness options available (including a lap pool), and not have to cross the Hood Canal bridge."
4dB6BQyO,I think this is a great idea for our area there isn’t a lot to do for kids around here. Although there’s a lot of low income families that may not be able to afford more tax it’s worth looking into another way for funding.
zMf8NaYw,Let’s do this but not tax us locals out
r8C4wfoF,"Use the current pool 4 times a week, this is VERY important to me."
YQC4OvhB,"We are highly in support of a new pool. We dont have kids at this time, but we both agree it is vitally important kids have access to swim lessons and a place to learn to be safe in and around water. Pools are also hugely beneficial to our older population or individuals with physical limitations. We are both former lifeguards and will absolutely use a new pool for lap swimming. Im personally not a huge fan of the lazy river idea. It sounds expensive to maintain and would make guarding more difficult. I know having enough guards is a problem at the current pool facility as is. I think a full sized lap pool and a smaller ""family"" pool 3.5 - 5ft deep would serve the community well. Lap swimmers and school practice would not have to share with swim lessons or water aerobics. We have no issue with a higher sales tax to support building a new facility. We are really looking forward to this project getting off the ground. Thank you for providing this survey."
1dC4vYt0,"The current Port Townsend pool is aging and the community needs a new pool. In the past political  pressures by a minority of people have obstructed that process. I hope that the County Council gives themselves the opportunity to act as leaders and approve a new pool. If costs are an issue (as they always are) please retain the aquatic aspect of the plan and let go of the non- aquatic. There are many  private and public non-aquatic activities already available, however there is no decent pool. Please, just be sensible and take the middle path this time."
uyB68bkM,"we are seniors so my answers are skewed that way. There’s a huge need in this community for programs that serve youth and younger children. This is not limited to swimming, of course. Indoor recreation opportunities are essential for people who live in the county instead of Port Townsend. I would pay more in taxes to see this happen."
cTCiLEdj,I would not like this and I will vote against it AGAIN! NO MORE TAXES!!!!!
dGB6dLfJ,"Don't spend any money on non-aquatic facilities, PERIOD.  If Jefferson Healthcare wants to use it for therapy, get them to pay and reduce the tax burden. Get some local, wealthy people to donate big bucks and put their name on the facility, lowering the tax burden."
q7B6TqMT,"There are too few people in this county to justify a public pool, not to mention that many would be unable to use it due to transportation distance and costs. I volunteer at the Quilcene food bank and weekly see how many people would NOT be served by a public aquatic facility, and these are only a small portion of the households that would not be using the facility. Too much time and money has already gone into this endeavor; it is time to stop and just drop it. If a pool is wanted, then let a private company or individual build it. If there are really enough people who want to use it, then it will be profitable for them. I suspect this would not be the case, though. (Which is likely why it has not already been done.)"
UrDT38IA,I do NOT want this facility to be funded by increasing the already high sales tax that this state mandates
86CYxXVO,"Don’t be greedy, we need modest facilities and then add on late."
0PkqXSlL,put it back in Port Townsend where it was meant to be or forget it and Port Townsend can seek a private nonprofit ymca plan to rebuild with a city groundlease at $1 per year without such ongoing nonsense. 1/3 of the population is in PT. Hadlock population has fallen to 3300 and Chimicum is half of that. Stop this nonsense.
GeDTkqkO,This seems far too expensive to build and maintain to justify use by so few of an already small population. There are so many other more pressing needs for our already limited resources.
pmkITotN,"The main thing we would go for is swimming/water play with the kids, plus swim lessons for the kids. Fingers crossed we get a new pool sooner than later. Thanks and good luck!"
6eCiypqK,It's crucial new facilities built in Jefferson county are advised from a sustainable approach. I'd like salt water or less chlorinated options to be explored.
TmCYSjx8,The overall cost outweighs usage. The city/county is slowly taxing fixed income residents out of their homes. This should be funded with private donations.
VzC4zrVi,"Now is not the time to be raising taxes for a facility that will only benefit a handful of people. If it can't be run self sufficiently on usage fees, it's not fair to make the whole county pay for something most will never use."
S2kEqMSE,"To be able to work out like the sequim Y then soak, steam, swim. I really want that.   And Indoor futsol/soccer"
pEB624y1,I ask to make sure everyone can afford it. I know when my son was young him being able to go to open swim was a big deal and there would have been no way I could afford the ymca. I didn't have much money but enough I didn't really qualify for help from the ymca. There would have been no way for me to pay for a day pass. Thanks
OVf3Gkr6,"Great idea, but we have more pressing issues in the county, such as housing and water systems."
N1kibORw,Use the funding for people at risk
iACiAcvX,I feel a new pool is needed in this area. I am 86 yrs old and my Doctor maintains that I am so much healthier now than I was before I started doing water aerobics some 7 years ago.
QcCYSOdy,"It would make sense to have a 50-meter pool with capability to partition into 2 25-yd pools to give swimmers in this area exposure to long-course practice and events, as well as traditional short-course."
v9CYwrN8,I really hope this comes to pass <3 swimming is so important to our community and having this as a wide-ranging public space would be a tremendous resource
S3C45LNM,"as an 87 year old man, it's paramount that the pool have easy access into the water like stairway with hand rail"
SNCY5Ckv,"We do not need other activities at this facility.  We already have two gyms, and a community center.  Just a 25 yd 6 lane lap pool and a warm water pool for physical therapy/toddler lessons.  Stop making it so complicated and expensive."
njDTBups,"Pools are expensive, require paid staff, lifeguards, cleaning and upkeep and expensive liability insurance. Data shows fewer people swim and that there is a nationwide shortage of lifeguards and aquatic centers across the U.S. have reduced hours because they cannot staff their pools. Public pools can spread disease if not properly maintained and even if they are, are unsanitary and contain urine and bodily fluids. Jefferson County's population is heavily senior. Why not save those funds for another use, and invest a fraction of what you have instead in supporting pickleball courts, the #1 growing sport globally and one seniors seem to love? There is virtually no upkeep, courts are heavily utilized and there will be no controversy or potential problems in relation to public showers, locker rooms as there have been in the past, not to mention slip and fall injuries and lawsuits and so on. No staff is needed (and the related administration and management required to hire, pay and manage them), no cleaning crews. It is an easy sport to learn and people of all ages and abilities are able to play. People bring their own racquets and equipment vs. pools which must purchase and inventory safety equipment and maintain it, as well as other items like paddleboards, floating devices and so on. Please review trends in pickleball usage vs. swimming pool trends and issues. Side note: I do not play pickleball so am not advocating for my own interests. But it seems an obvious choice to support an easy-to-implement system of self-maintaining pickleball courts at a fraction of the cost vs. swimming pools which are costly and are never a good ROI...I think when people hear about having a pool the concept of it seems like a nice thing for a community to have. But digging deeper, it really is a huge cost and maintenance for our rural area that does not make sense. Lastly, there is always the argument that seems to override many of the practical issues, which is it is a safety issue that children must learn to swim. I completely agree it is an important skill for our children. But certainly we could work out some agreement with surrounding communities that already have pools, such as in Sequim, Poulsbo, Bainbridge, etc. to utilize their pools for swimming lessons versus starting from the ground up here and building an entire ""aquatic center."" Thank you for the opportunity to voice this opinion."
t2DTcOTs,"Please build a new pool! This is an important community resource. Pools help with play and confidence for youth and provide connection and fitness for adults. As a swimmer, and a previous lifeguard, I see the positive impact pools can have for people who use them. Make it available, accessible and welcoming space for all.   Please make a pool that is low cost for people to use, supports vulnerable community needs like showering, and is welcoming to lgbtq folks, and create a space that support people with disabilities- both young and old."
GJk6F21T,"We NEED this for the health and joy for our community. Teaching our littles to be confident in the water is so important.  I believe it would benefit ALL, young and old, rich and poor.  Thank you for the important work you are doing."
rMfdf0jm,how much has been spent on pool planning over the last 10 years?  Do you have a ballpark budget for this facility?
1iB6eOki,It appears to me that the current pool cannot keep employees and spending millions of dollars on a new pool you cannot afford to staff is a risk. Where will your employees be able to afford to live on their income? The committee making these decisions needs to have a clear picture of the hiring history of the current pool.
5DfmHhlE,"I would only be interested if you built a YMCA like facility with excellent fitness offerings; Cardio room, weight room with selectorized and or plate loaded equipment, Cable-Column machine, free weights, Smith Machine, indoor track, outdoor fitness equipment, tennis/Pickleball courts, basketball court, steam room, wellness center with association with Physical Therapy and Personal Training, etc.."
QpCYtvlH,"This needs to be a aquatic center that fulfills community needs, not geared as a tourist attraction, because no matter how great it might be, people come to the peninsula to experience our outdoor amenities."
h7CiE5iD,"Probably won't use it, depending upon handicap accessibility."
wfCKUcB3,Concerned about finding enough lifeguards and instructors to meet deep and shallow water classes full time.
E4CYT3YD,I think this a great opportunity for people with kids. It needs to be open to people who don't have a lot of income or I would not support it. The questions were geared towards me and my spouse. I think it might be good to ask some questions about what I might support even if I wouldn't personally use it.
bKB6GKkj,This really needs to happen. Please find a way.
PPfbKoQv,So important to get this done!
HqfwpLSm,"As a youth SAW(Safety around Water) instructor for the Salish elementary children I've seen first hand how it's vital for our community to have an aquatics facility. Just as important is the low impact fitness training  that a pool makes available for our older population. Blue skies, . Mike  The since of community, and joy that an aquatics facility provides is an priceless commodity. ."
ngkaWLmc,I am delighted about the location for the new facility (centrally located) and look forward to supporting it.  Thank you Jefferson Aquatics for championing this.
aEkRNQLg,Thank you!!  We need a new pool!  Please make the indoor shallow pool area warm and fun (think Shore aquatic center in PA).  Children in our community desperately need a fun and warm aquatic play area.
NREBF30s,I am excited about the new facility being located in Port Hadlock!! I would love to swim more but the location and hours of the current pool make it hard. We are a household that would love to use a combo facility that included a pool and an indoor rock wall.
VHB6PTV2,"Curious if there are other sites in the Port Hadlock Chimacum area that could serve as the site? Does the proposed site already have enough public transportation connections and junction points? Is there already enough parking lots that won’t be maxed out? Do you need to create another parking lot and add more impermeable space? Could this project be completed in phases ( aquatic first) then other potential things later? Use of facility: children’s swimming lessons, open play, water therapy exercise"
TQCKtgZV,"It is imperative that the focus of an aquatic center be a competitive 25 yard lap swimming pool with blocks and cool, clear water, around 79°F. A secondary pool for water walking/exercising (or even laps) can be available and kept in the 84 to 86° range.  Port Angeles has done this well, as has Bainbridge. I’m sure you have visited those facilities and spoken with management. If you have not, please do!  (the 79° pool at Bainbridge will be closing February 16 for over a year).  Also imperative is planning ahead for staffing. High schoolers and younger are the future pool staff. MVP used to be staffed by swimmers (girls high school team). Years ago I spoke with Peter, the PTHS girls swim coach, and he told me title IX allows there to be a girls swim team, but there is no boys swim team. Rectifying that must be set in motion now, not only for equity, but for future staffing.  Also consider the unusual step of having a studio apartment or two included in the facility, where a manager could reside. Similar to how HJ Carroll Park has a live-in caretaker. This would resolve some of the “I can’t find anywhere to live“ problem that potential staff face.   The SHORE aquatic center uses a saltwater solution, rather than chlorine. I think that would be welcomed by the people who live in this area.  I highly recommend establishing a culture of ‘everyone must shower before entering the pool.’ This would be unpopular at first, but would greatly benefit community health, water clarity, and longevity of the equipment and facility.  Some may say that they want all the fun things included in an aquatic center (slides, swings, climbing walls). My observation is that large aquatic play areas take up a lot of space yet are rarely used. Perhaps include one or two ‘fun’ things.  Mountain View pool is too hot. 10 years ago it was warm, but swimmable. 86° is unhealthy, bad for the equipment, expensive and polluting. MVP is the only pool I have swum that is not uncomfortable when you first get in. That is not correct. Cold water gets one moving. Moving gets one’s heart rate up. One should not be able to stop and chat for an extended period of time in a lap swimming pool.   I swim in Sequim in a pinch, but have found they are going the way of MVP, with warmer and cloudier pool water. While the Y turned that facility around after it was mismanaged, ideally I would go without the Y, as long as there is good management. Port Angeles and Bainbridge are your best local models for effective community aquatic centers.  Thank you for taking the time to read and for all your efforts in bringing aquatics to East Jefferson County."
mFCKbnb3,This would benefit every age group across the board. We live near water and it is improtant to have swimming lessons close by. We have been driving 45 min to the Y in Silverdale. I grew up having access to a community pool and as I age I would love to use it for exercise and rehab if injured. A coffee shop and social gathering place would also be such a benefit to the area.
3tCYW6GJ,"For me, having a gym and other fitness resources/classes is a critical park of the facility to make it all inclusive of non-swimmers. Other counties has heavily utilized recreation departments that offer various fitness (and arts) classes. Look at Kitsap and Bainbridge recreation as models that could be scaled to size. This assures that there are accessible class offerings to the community."
FuCYOM3t,This is so exciting. Very much in favor. I'm a mom with many kids and this would change everything.
TOfOwbkf,"A sauna is important to have in the facility and would be used weekly, especially during winter months, including for health reasons"
jVCKsKzN,Pickleball should be a huge part of this effort. It’s clear that there is significant demand for limited pickleball court access. Pickleball is fastest growing sport and swimming is clearly not. I’m glad that location has moved closer to population centroid.
2rkHF1fT,"The premise at the outset of the survey that rehabilitation/repair of the current pool facility is stated as fact without any support.   If you begin the survey with this premise, and if it is supported by research and investigation you should state this and explain what work was done to determine this.   It may very well be true but it deserves a short explanation about how this conclusion was reached.   Some people responding to this survey may be put off by a survey that begins from that premise without more."
0YC4UmV2,"With all the health and welfare needs in most communities, I would much rather see the money spent for those kinds of programs in our community."
HMk3Orct,"We pay quarterly for our pool in Port Ludlow, so will not support a request for an additional tax for this project.  Communities in this situation should be excluded from this tax."
xMEBhrG8,"I completely support an aquatic center. However I have reservations about it turning into a complete sports and health facility. While I love the idea of those add-ons, I can’t afford any more taxes to pay for it. Keep it focused on aquatics and I am 100% supportive."
29fPKkxO,"Our family of four loves swimming and being in the water. My wife and I are high level swimmers, sadly our children are not due to Jefferson Counties poor facilities. We often travel to the pools in PA and Silverdale as an alternative, taking our dollars there when we swim. We are open to a Hadlock or PT location and will gladly pay the taxes and entrance fees to support this project. Thank you for your work on this very important issues for our children and the future of Jefferson County."
tdDTvmcl,too far away
Q2CixZ2J,Disappointed that you didn’t use the data collected by the task force on choosing the site.
H7B64Ipz,We need housing
tdDTLjez,The old one is good enough.
3aB64mss,Why is the facility planned for Port Hadlock?  Is it because county residents outside of PT don’t want to pay for something that is located in PT?  Please consider the reverse of that when asking PT residents to pay for a facility in Hadlock.
DSkotVig,I am a Masters swim coach and coach adults learning to swim. I'm very excited to bring this skill to the pool.
fmCKygAw,"In order to maximize the usage of this pool, I believe it is imperative that family and kid friendly features be installed, including a lazy River and other splash features. Kids want to spend time in places that are fun, and parents will take them to have fun. This pool needs to compete with the fun pools in PA and Bainbridge in order to maximize usage. Parents with kids that are strong swimmers who don’t need constant supervision, also would love to be able to soak in a hot tub or sauna to relax for once. Please include a hot tub! Thanks so much for all your hard work in getting this project going!"
XJEBIIzH,"I’m ecstatic about a new aquatic center and would use it regularly!  We have needed a better, reliable facility for decades!"
gTf8Swyv,"I believe we, especially the kids, need a min of 25 yard pool. I am not sure if 25yd or 25 meter is important for competitive swimming. A separate depend diving area with a 1 and 3 meter board would be great.  I learned how to swim at age 5 and was a junior Olympic swimmer by 8. It is so very important for our kids to swim. They are surrounded by water! Swimming is the best exercise for lungs and body with out jarring impact. Let's do this! Melissa  melmoller@gmail.com"
WlEBSgOC,I would support this even though I don’t like to swim at public pools because I like to see families engaged in healthy activities.
ebCiOhyE,A facility like the Port Angles pool which uses salt water is ideal.  The temperature for lap swimming needs to be correct and not too warm.  How can individuals help in making the po a reality?
phB60Cgm,I am so glad to see this moving forward!  I've been swimming at Mt View for almost 50 years.  It has been patched back together so many times.  Our community desperately needs a new aquatic facility.
nmEBlJMN,Sounds like a great idea! I’d love a spin class but I suppose buying a bunch of bikes is out of the question?
7AB6HvCR,I hope it happens! I would really love it and use it often.
nHC4h4If,"Keep the cost down. We are a rural county that cannot afford $40,000,000"
a3EBLweQ,"This county can’t afford a facility such as this being paid for with a sales tax of 0.20 or 20 cents per hundred dollars. The idea that this is will be enough to fund the millions of dollars needed to build a project like this a nightmare not a dream. The facility that was talked about in Port Townsend had a price tag of a hundred million dollars, if this facility is ever  twenty percent the size of that one the cost is over 25 million dollars, This county has more important things to spend this kind of money on."
e8fEwhwc,I am a masters swimmer and coach and I would love to get a masters team started at this facility.
tvCiLPyC,"A quality pool is the much needed. Swimming is a life skill, especially in a maritime community, and lifelong activity. We desperately need a pool that is at least 25 yards and can support 6-8 lap lanes that can be open during lap swim. In addition, we need a pool that has a diving board area and childrens area. We dont have to look far for a good model with Shore Aquatic Center in PA. I do believe the pool should be located in the main population center-- port townsend. It is disappointing to see this has shifted and still leaves/defers an aging building (mountainview) problem unfixed. Further creating sprawl. This will only cause more people to drive, increasing co2 emissions and causing other access issues."
9nB6DVsD,Can't understand why anyone would not want a pool. Not only for myself but for the kids in all of our communities. It's essential.
yQCYm7RG,Good luck! This would be an amazing addition to our community!
WFDTsHhm,The site by habitat is not ideal - it's off of major arteries and poses a challenge for those who live rural. Would prefer the site across from HJ Carrol Park - easier access for more county residents.
D3CKRR3H,"I hope this happens, thank you for your efforts!"
NukYCTrf,Establishing a high class center such as this next to a low cost housing development with its potential problems would seem to defy common sense
3RfLIPlb,"Most people in Port Ludlow have access to a pool and rec facilities at one of the two clubs. We don't, and I really miss having a swimming pool close by. I planned to vote for the pool even if it were in Port Townsend, where I don't often go, because of its value to the community. But if it's in Port Hadlock, it's close enough that I can use it!"
jmkclODC,Thank you for picking a more centralized spot.   I can hardly wait to stretch my arms in a pool again.
ZlEBq6xp,"I support the goal of a new aquatic facility , a reasonably big pool with an area for young children. In my opinion, saunas, gymnasiums,or meeting/event spaces are superfluous to the need for a pool that will last for many years. If it is built I intend to use it occasionally. My extended family members in the area would use it more frequently."
s5CiDnBr,Since I live in Port Ludlow and have access to the facilities at SBCA I probably wouldn't use this.  If I had visitors from out of the area I might bring them to some activities and pay the fee.
KqCikKIq,I have concerns about trying to be more than an aquatic center and creating a burden for maintenance and sustainability.  The project planners need to be clear about the end goal and not try to include additional non-aquatic infrastructure that will be costly to sustain just to gain interest.  Must also keep n mind the impact on the environment of Hadlock-Irondale in terms of public safety.
zff6jgxO,"I feel that it would be best to focus efforts on creating an excellent recreational and lap swim pool facility that could also serve needs of competitive training for students in ways that Mountain View was not adequate for. The added costs of cafe, gyms, fitness center, kitchen, splash pads, spas, etc are frivolous and unnecessary. There are plenty of other businesses in the are that provide those services, plus we have miles of beach to visit if people want to play outside in the water. Please focus on the simplest version of a pool facility so that the costs are minimized. Thank you."
VRB6r5ER,"I want a well designed, functional and well staffed pool with locker rooms and showers. I do not want or need any of the expensive “could be nice to have, but not necessities”. I want this project to succeed!"
ZPCKwSaE,Please go with 25 meters rather than 25 yards. As an ex-varsity springboard diver I’d like to see at least 1 meter boards.
GZB6CZ7M,Thanks for your efforts
T0kG4O1a,"Just as it's important for there to be shallow water play for infants, there also needs to be a deep end for bigger kids/teens who want to dive, play games like ""sharks and minnows"" and build swimming stamina.  I strongly support the idea of indoor gymnasium space with sports courts/ climbing wall/ work-out equipment/ as there are almost no indoor facilities open on weekends for kids/teens/families to be active during rainy winter months. This is a huge part of community wellness and creating space for these makes it much more likely for an entire family to visit the facility (from PT or county or out of county) and ensures there will be something for everyone to do and stay active. I think it would be ideal to think of this as a community wellness center not just an aquatic center. Similar facilities in our region get tons of use and meet the needs of all ages of our population."
DJfb8oEE,"I’ll be moving full time to the Port Ludlow area in the fall. When I become a Jefferson County voter, I will vote yes to new pool funding."
L7EBYv6e,"A recreation center was built in the town of about 20,000 more than 25 years ago and immediately became a major gathering center for many activities including private events and class reunions as well as the pool and fitness activities. It is now going through major expansion.  here is a link to their site.   https://www.brightonco.gov/392/Facility-Rentals"
7lB6e2jo,"I LOVE TO SWIM, BUT DO NOT USE THE PT POOL, I DO NOT TRUST THE FACILITY."
1cCizKjy,It would be nice to know exactly what activities the facility would have - how can you determine (unless it's a guesstamate) the in creased sales tax if you do not know the ultimate cost of the facility?
ubCiXkts,"I think having the taxpayers wanting to pay for something that a minority of the taxpayers will even be using… Only a fraction of the population in Jefferson County would use it. Have the philanthropist use their money, and leave the taxpayers out of it!"
bIEBtVCX,How much would it cost for a person owning a $500K house per year.  How much would it cost to swim per person?
s1DTdhg2,"I find it difficult to understand why the pool is going to an area that requires most users to drive 20 minutes to use the pool.  Likewise, students would have to be bussed to and from the pool for events and lessons.  The study that used to justify locating in Hadlock was inherently skewed to support a specific conclusion.  If Port Townsend's population is excluded from the 20 minute radius for measurement, how many people are left in the total?  Probably a fraction of the total.  I think the location choice is poor,  but City of PT will probably like getting out from under the current pool subsidy and spreading it over all of East Jefferson county."
4hf1bARf,"I like the central location to best serve the county, and I think this is an important addition for the families of Jefferson County!"
U2DTn6ZD,I think it is important for the kids in the area to have a place to go for activities the aquatic center will provide. It would also be beneficial for adults to get exercise in a way that was not previously offered or available
34C42x0J,Would be a great asset to the community for all age groups.
k4kPW46e,"Create meeting rooms that seniors and parent/toddler groups use during the day and teens or adult groups use at night. Offer cpr classes and have blood draw/donation sessions. Really engage the “social” aspect of the flu but PLEASE ensure it does not become an under supervised teen hang out. Adequate staff with firm behavior rules is essential to get right, from the start otherwise it will not be a multi generational use facility. I have lived in two other states where a great new facility was built and then run by the Y, but immediately turned into a teen posing, hook-up, hang out space. I’m not anti-teens, just saying the appropriate management of the facility once built is as important for its community success."
3ikA1hoU,Please make them salt water pools! This makes them accessible to many more people.
FMDTohWS,i hope you make it grand so i would be likely to go more than i anticipate and take my niece and nephew !
HBC4Mh74,Sooner the better!
9oB6vwBW,"I would love to access to work out facilities in Hadlock during the winter. I didn’t really care for a port Townsend pool, but have gotten excited about the new location in port Hadlockvclose to my home . I could ride my bike to the purposed site and would enjoy pool access and fitness classes like yoga. I would also love a public gym for cardio and weights., A sauna and showers woukd be amazing!!!!"
EOCin7I2,"Please, please, please plan for a saline system. I have been swimming in a saline pool for many years now. The difference is so significant that I will no longer patronize chlorinated pools at all."
rIB6mEmb,Not at all interested in paying for this.
4OB6tJej,I am opposed.  I am already assessed to support 2 pools in my HOA. stop raising taxes! Trimming the county budget downward is a better idea.
LtB6qmpu,"It's important for the schools and the county to have access to a quality facility. We live in the North Bay area of Port Ludlow and are blessed with 2 pools. We will gladly support a pool in the Port Hadlock area. Thank you, Adele Govert and Dean Morgan"
fIEBVuDg,This is so important for the young families in our area
6SCi249U,"Need to look at population dynamics - Jeffco is over 60% older folks greater than 60. 16% may be less than 20. It does not look like this will change. We are the 7th oldest county in the US and first in WA. Look at uses that are more relevant to older people. If you support younger people, what is the cost per person? Meeting school requirements is fine but going into other functions for an aquatic facility is a detraction. Is the purpose to provide a rec center for the Triarea? If so say that is a purpose. However I believe that if you go in this direction you will detract from support for just an aquatic center. I believe there are other places that people can go to get many of the services you list here. There are extensive sport facilities and a rec center in Quilcene. There is a rec center in Chimacum Park (or at least a meeting area). There are numerous sports fields where pickleball courts could be built (Bates, HG Carroll) and there are pickleball courts at the Courthouse. Will a climbing wall benefit retired folks? Won't ownership by an org other than Parks and Rec confuse things? The bottom line - I will support an aquatic center for swimming. I won't support a recreation facility that tries to appeal to everyone - we already have that."
hOkrSaKq,"Although our family would not participate in youth activities, we do think they are important to the needs of a diverse community. We are curious to know what the future plans are for the Mountain View Pool facility if the new aquatics center is built."
kiDT8dqn,"You need to give a rough estimate of what additional add-ons to pool  (sauna, rock wall, community kitchen etc) would cost so people could decide if those things are worth the additional cost (building cost, staffing costs etc) before they say they want them.  Will the cost of using a rock wall put it out of reach of people who have said they want it.  I can't use the current pool because the fees are too high."
KcC4HY9I,"I would highly object to building a pool with public funds then having it run by the YMCA.  I believe that would be a misuse of public funds for a private organizations gain. The Y took over the Sequim Aquatic center and raised the rates, which are significantly higher than at the Port Angeles pool.  If the pool is built with public funds, it should be run by the county."
fSfPY3dm,This facility would be an amazing asset to our community. People of all ages would benefit from this.
y0CKgLwZ,"SO GLAD TO SEE THESE DEVELOPM,ENTS"
08fzd3vQ,"A Port Hadlock/Tri-Area location will be certain to increase accessibility and participation for more county residents, their guests and area visitors. Aquatic activities are a great boon to fitness, fun and wellbeing for all age groups."
z8EB5boK,"I think this is extremely important for children, teens, families ..  years ago, I taught a water safety /cold water survival course to teens in Alaska - very popular - and proved useful ."
uTDTzlC8,Thank you!
XQDTVef6,"Pool Hours, should be hours for seniors only for both lap and open, 65+ Youth hours should be for youth only. Schools pay for use Toddler hours should be just before maintenance. private showers or walls between stalls nobody gets in free,no free rides  pay to use no matter"
dXC4anmI,Thanks for championing this project!
frB6Md0y,"Please keep it simple.  Make it a pool, not a theme park.  Plenty of lap lanes, a consistent schedule, clean."
euEBjBzA,"We in this household think it is a complete  and total waste of funds!  Taxes keep increasing to the bursting point. And like all other county entities, such as county roads, they declare they are short staffed and cannot afford to take care of secondary roads. We vote a decided NO and feel it will not sustain itself. It’s still a long way to drive from Brinnon, Quilcene and other points in south county. So much money has been expended in pushing this agenda, let’s stop wasting money."
FSCKrPkF,"No, No, No, Never, Stop the over taxing of us!!!!!"
KODTtaqg,LAP POOL SWIMS
j1EBEWry,* Large single family restroom/changing rooms suitable for people with babies and kids of all ages and abilities would be necessary for making families feel safe using the facilities.   * Saline instead of chlorine and warm enough for babies and elderly.   * No taxes to fund the project. Get grants and federal or state funding. Only charge people who use the facilities and set up scholarships and sponsorships for those that can't afford to.
nFEBckOS,We soooooo need this for our children to be confident swimmers and it will keep dollars in our county. In the winter we travel once a week to other places to swim and we spend money there eating out!
czCKV9bA,Pool for swimming lessons and fun! And outdoor splash pad would really sweeten the deal.
ZyEBwlZv,I'd like to see a zero clearance pool so elders could enter the pool easily and the very young would be safer.  I'm not a fan of chlorine (it makes my eyes and nose run) could UV be used? or some other less toxic disinfectant? I'd love to have access to water exercise classes.
PPEBA8ZV,"Please find a way to make this new facility happen & bring the Port Townsend area a facility that rivals Silverdale, Sequim & Port Angeles. If you build it they will come!!!"
Y1B6eLLL,"Partnering with the schools, they bus the kids to the new aquatic facility after school. They have time to eat a snack, do homework, have individual time to decompress, then begin swim practice. Parents or bus system can take them home at 6pm. Perfect daycare/after school child care while learning how to be on a swim team, which makes natural born leaders. Something our county desperately needs."
O9C4nebC,"Streets NOT pools!!!!  Infrastructure maintence and repair before palaces for special interest groups!!!  And whatever you fools do, DO NOT BAIL OUT the city and it's failures!"
mnC4ETEf,"If you are considering an outdoor or convertible pool to help with cost, Hood River OR has an amazing community pool that would be worth looking at for a case study. As a family with a young child having a pool near by is critical for us to be able to teach her how to swim and be safe in a town surrounded by water."
1ZDTXprL,"My household makes the drive to Port Angeles' Shore Aquatic Center 2x a month from Port Townsend. That is a well-run facility and it is worth the drive. It would be incredible if East Jefferson County had something comparable to Shore. We would absolutely be coming weekly if not more than that. Would also like to add that family changing rooms would be a great addition, as well as a lazy river pool feature, which is fun for all. Thanks for considering."
IsDTn8Zw,"Hadlock is not the heart of Jefferson County. Pool should be near hwy 104 (plenty of land there, good road connections) so people from the rest of the county can reach it just as easily as Port Townsend people.  This is not a county pool, in a county location, this is a Port Townsend pool.  The continued arrogance of Port Townsend trying to force the rest of the county to pay for it's pool is incredible.  Port Townsend is far wealthier than the rest of the county, if they want a pool, fine, they should pay for it.  If we are building a pool for all of us, then put it in a location for all of us.  Also, stop trying to Port Townsend-up this pool with a zillion extras.  Just build a solid, basic pool.  This Port Townsend non-grounded in reality thinking led to Cherry St debacle, Fort Worden debacle.  Inability to maintain basic roads and utilities in Port Townsend, etc.  Based on this survey I see a lot of the same non-realistic Port Townsend thinking going into this pool.  Put the pool down at Hwy 104, make it a basic pool (no add ons), then we will all pay for it and all use it."
x3B6wvFr,"Although we are senior citizens, we strongly support family programs and swim lessons for all. A Port City like PT needs water safety. But I also really like water aerobics. I hope this passes."
rsC4zXdZ,Exceeding needed. Pls pls pls.
H2CKTOZ6,"I believe the cheaper you make it, the more people will be willing to pay taxes. I think it is a mistake to try to go beyond the aquatic facility notion. If you start trying to spend money on pickleball courts, cafes, etc. the cost will just get too high.  Why not consider doing the development in two stages? Try to get the aquatic facility built first? See if it is successful, then possibly add a recreation facility later? I am willing to pay more taxes but many of my neighbors out here in the County are Republican, and they are totally against an increase of taxes. This will never work unless you make it as reasonable in cost as possible. There are a lot of rich people in Port Townsend, but not out here in the County."
ReC4A64s,"Do not go small. The demand will grow exponentially over time. We use Shore pool in Port Angeles which is a fabulous lap/ swimmers/ activities pool and it can get easily overcrowded. The pool becomes such a center of community for those who live in Port Angeles, west end, and Sequim. Such a healthy outlet for the young folks as well. The pool operates in the black $$ and they are able to keep it affordable. Conversely, the YMCA in Sequim is expensive and caters more to older folks who are not lap swimmers. Lots of water aerobics and group activities that take over the lap lanes limiting lap swim. So important to have a separate activities pool / area so that the lap lanes are available all day. The pool and sauna are such important therapy spots for veterans who suffer from an assortment of mental health and physical health issues. I am one of those veterans and fully understand the benefits. Make sure the sauna is large enough. The Shore pool sauna is shoulder to shoulder in the evenings when folks are off of work. The sauna gets busy in the mornings as well after early morning lap swim and the aerobics sessions are finished.Spend some time and talk with Steve, the board president, or Mike, the daily pool maintenance guy about what improvements they would make. Think big and think of the future growth of our community and its future needs. The people will definitely come to use the facility especially once they experience its benefits and view it as one of the centers of community. Thanks, Tim Walls, Sequim."
9PB6ycwg,I would love to be able to use an aquatic and recreational center in Jefferson County. I would also like to be able to use the changing/shower room but I would not be able to use it if males are going to be allowed in the women's areas.
dJDT1eK4,Unfair to west Jeff co homeowners to pay higher tax for a pool/center they have to drive hours to get to.
PsCYW1NY,i only use the pool in port townsend because its close to where i live. i probably wouldnt't use it much if it were in port hadlock.
FTfRs31R,I have been using the pool for almost 28 years since I retired to Port Townsend.  I am 88 years old and proud to say that I am the oldest one in our aerobics class. That is what keeps me going.
O2CYrVmd,The community needs this facility.
RUCYWP2A,Hurry up and build it. I am 78 years old.
9pB6SVUM,I love the idea of it being in Hadlock. I think more people will use it and have access to it including children who need to learn how to swim!
NJC451SU,"I believe a county pool is necessary for people of this community. It could be used for schools for swimming teams, classes for all ages, rehab for patients, exercise for seniors and recreation for all ages. The people of this county need more places for recreation."
sfEBo6eV,"This facility should be placed within the Port Townsend city limits, in a location that's walkable / bikable for local youth. Placing it miles out of town down a 50mph highway is short sighted and will impact attendance."
fwCiojg1,Yes we need a pool which has do many health benefits and community benefits
UEC4W7wc,There are so many families moving to this area. I strongly support healthy family activity like swimming.
OFCiE6Q3,Extended hours for lap swimming would be ideal to be able to avoid crowds. Or perhaps a lane reservation system.
tDCKALmf,I would like it to be salt water rather than chlorine.... Outdoor elements could include splash pool playground & adult fitness stations.
w1CKkERa,"Need to know outcomes, such as will it support itself after being built.  How long will the tax be implemented.  What other metrics will you use to determine if it is successful."
27CibVXO,"I would really appreciate it if planners for this pool operation would seriously consider the pool being safely treated with non-chlorinating chemicals, if all possible."
C5C4nZDt,I am handicapped and swimming is the only physical activity I can enjoy.
TtfxnzdR,"I want to know if this is a septic or sewer facility. I’m disappointed it is moving from Port Townsend and will use it less frequently with my kids. I hope no tent like exterior is being considered and only a traditional structure.   It is great to see family programs surveyed. I would also like to know the plan for staffing these programs. We have been promised a daycare for years and our head start is at risk of closing but neither there is not enough staff to keep a pool in PT open consistently and the daycare can’t open for the city because there’s no director. The last time I completed a comprehensive survey for the pool myself and other families showed up en masse to complete it. When the aggregate results were shown our feedback for family recreation was obvious. But the proposed architectural plans included almost nothing for kids. No lazy river, no climbing wall, no splash pad. I also think that a European model of a coffee shop with a walk in pool would be best. Parents can sit and have a drink and snack for kids and watch them from the table at the edge of the pool. It’s also important to have a sound barrier between types of pool activities and lessons."
C5kBHQgC,Do not support building a new aquatic and recreation facility. Look at the demographics here. This county has a population of 65 and older closing in at around 44%.Prices are high enough in this county. Young families can't afford to live here so who's going to use this new facility? This isn't Bainbridge Is. or Bellevue.
BICYyx7z,"I think adding more activities for kids, teens, and young adults will make living in the area better and give the youth things to do around the small towns"
0CfEiAcq,Partnering with jefferson healthcare to have a PT clinic adjacent to the space to help with financials and accessibility to high quality healthcare and transition to wellness center exercise options and/or onsite aquatic therapy services.
PACKefBI,Even though I would not use the facility I support it. I have access to to a pool in port ludlow where I live. Thank you I think this is very important for the children and adults in Jefferson county.
5KfeMQET,"Affordability. Classes, passes, etc. need to be affordable for the average household.  Access to swim before and after work hours (8-5).   I'm sure this is a priority, but year-round swimming - indoor options.  Swimming lessons for kids!  I don't know if this is possible - but if there's digital passes, a live counter on the website that shows how many people are accessing the facility at the time. I would love to be able to see if it's crowded or not before leaving the house.  A rock wall over the water like PA had would be LOVED by my family."
RWB6JvGu,This would be great but the proposed tax is too high. I think the program should be funded in other ways such as memberships and subsidies for low income.
6gEBaitJ,Have a bike (walking) path leading to pool facility from main highway
WeCYvpmp,"This is a cornerstone facility for our county. It would be important to our family to offer hours that are friendly to a working family and not just retirees. As for myself, I would fully train there several days a week if bouldering/gym facilities were offered as well."
cFB6kIYN,Locker and shower areas for women only. Men or transwomen should have these facillities separate from women.  Women need privacy and safety. Thank you all for sticking with this process. It is so important that the county have a community pool.  Please do not force any identity ideology on patrons. Everyone should have  access to the community pool. A separate public bathhouse with shower facilities would be very civilized.
vXCYjZSu,"Keep it simple. A pool of the proper size for training and swim meets for school teams, locker rooms, showers, bathroom, office and one or two rooms for child care. Swim lessons for students in all three districts in their PE classes is a must.  We cannot provide the long term financial support for a big-city facility with added amenities like a gym, hot tub, exercise facilities. We can barely manage to staff the one we have. People want a pool. Build a beautiful one!"
bnCYO2t8,Remodel/refurbish the pool in Port Townsend and have PT residents pay for it and maintain it. The majority of county residents do NOT support this and it appears people are not listening and hell bent on doing it anyway.
k8C4VWpK,I am so excited about the proposed location. It could be such a wonderful resource for growing families and build a much needed center for Jefferson County. I live in Port Townsend and work in the county and would happily use this facility weekly instead of going to Bainbridge or Sequim.
lJfit0H9,"Although our household answers are geared for two older women, we have grandchildren and nieces and nephews with whom we will absolutely support the building of this Aquatic Center. REALLY wish it had been built 30 years ago, but we'll take what we can get!  Please know that we also support programs for our teens as well."
mekbPYDi,I would only use the pool if it were kept clean with salt water and a minimal amount of chlorine. I cannot use pools like the one in Sequim because of its extremely high chlorine levels because my skin breaks out. Please consider a salt-water or other mild cleaning system!
ezCinqqj,"A gym would be the most important thing to me. The gyms in jeffco are severely outdated. If the facility could be comparable to the silverdale ymca I would be there every day. A full gym with up to date state of the art equipment , indoor track, indoor climbing, indoor pool, steam sauna, dry sauna, hot tub, ice baths. Both me and my mom would be there every afternoon if these things were available. If it's just a pool my mom might come once a week and I'd come once every month or two. Please build a gym!"
l6DTd8qB,Would be THRILLED with an outdoor pool with lap lanes that would allow for summer swim team for children. 
viCiV70S,Fully support the new location and would love an outdoor option.
GEC4koIE,Thank you for continuing to pursue the new pool project and make it more accessible to the county. The county needs a full court basketball size indoor gym. The school gyms are often closed and difficult to reserve and the county rec gym is beyond outdated and too small.
1oB6iT4l,We want this
8ZCKhqaO,Please do not allow the YMCA to operate
EECY3pVh,"I have tried to use the Mountain view pool for lap swimming to build strength and increase my health, but the lap lanes were far too packed and I did not feel like I had the space necessary to work on becoming a better swimmer. Additionally, the hours for lap swimming at the MVP are incredibly limited.   I believe that a community aquatic center in the Tri Areas would help me meet my health goals, and may help others do the same."
L5CYmRhq,"Even though I am a senior, we need more programs for families and teens in our county. This facility would do a great job of filling some of those needs!"
ioB6FRd2,"As wonderful of an idea as this is, it just doesn't seem logical. With the average age in east Jefferson most likely over 65. The families that live here year-round would most likely prefer something to help the community more than an aquatic center. How about some competition for grocery stores so people can afford food. or housing (yes, I am aware of the projects going in) or find ways to lower some of the already extremely high taxes we spend in this county. how about we start with making programs for the youth in this county or creating sustainable jobs. This whole project just seems like more of a want than a need. instead of hiring the wrong people because they are friends or acquaintances and then spending hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring outside firms to tell us what went wrong when its common sense, we should square ourselves away before we scrape the barrel of the citizens who are already struggling."
xTk4gnWk,"I am glad this is still being thought about and seems to be moving forward!  This is important for our community, and especially our youth.  I'd like to learn how to swim as an adult, and my daughter needs to learn too!"
ZBfxpt0j,A Lazy River  with a whirlpool and a shallow children's area such as the Shore aquatic center has would be awesome. Also the temperature if the water there is much more comfortable.
2vk3Ww6V,"I don not have kids at home anymore, but a solid aquatic center is truly vital for kids to have activities and swimming lessons. I would love to see it as more like a traditional YMCA, with other classes likes aerobics and a fitness center."
EfEBJGOu,Those that don't use the facility should not have to pay for it.  Charge  the people who want to use it.  Sales tax is high enough already!!!!
2JCYMDwz,"I am a lap swimmer and swim 2 miles at a time x2 times weekly. I'd want the pool to have ample hours for all 6 lanes lap swimming. The problem with Mt. View, besides the obvious is there aren't enough lanes and times for lap swimming."
uLfGyZur,"My primary interests lie in a space to provide access to activities for young children, such as swim lessons and daycare. That is a limiting factor in raising a family out here. The prospect of a bouldering facility is also very intriguing."
xCCYkNMW,"I would like to see the YMCA in Port Townsend become more stabilized. What are we doing with the pool we already have? My child goes to the YMCA afterschool program. Will the new facility help her? She's in Port Townsend, not Hadlock. Will Chimacum have an after-school program at the facility? What will Port Townsend do? The school busses do not go to the hadlock area from PT."
uLkY0ymY,Just don't tax the gas in this county as that is high enough.
U4B6DGo9,Weight room fitness center needed
blCKiGKk,"I raised 3 competitive  swimmers who became lifeguards during their high school and college years, and have 6 grandchildren who are pursuing swimming. I highly recommend an aquatic facility being developed in East Jefferson County so other young people have this opportunity to become water safe, learn a life long skill that can also lead to summer employment for High School and College.  Many other water activities can be included with having a complete aquatic and recreation facility close to homes."
o0B69B56,It would be amazing if we could include a gym as well.
dVCisqzS,Upgrade what exists
UdC4KZLs,we are older so the kid thing does not appeal to us. we would use it for lap swimming/exercise only
wSDTCCmw,I feel the location by the Chimacum Primary School is the best choice.
h0kZCkAy,"I don't believe Jefferson County can afford to build it. Maybe if we could get a few large retail type stores like Clallam or Kitsap (Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, etc.) we would have the sales tax to do it."
LkC4xEu0,Thank you Greg and Heidi for making sure that an Aquatic Center benefits the highest number of residents.  You have moved the axis of the planet from Port Townsend to the UGA!
QKEB2eSr,"As long as biological males are allowed in the women's dressing room, we don't need a new aquatic and recreation facility in Jefferson County.   On top of that we are literally being taxed to death as it is.  It is fine for rich people moving in but for those of us who have lived here all of our lives and don't have high paying jobs, it is ridiculous to abuse the people who are just trying to survive."
hIfZ3VL4,There are way more important things in this county to spend money on other than an aquatic center!
tFDTNKkR,Would be nice to have a gym with exercise equipment at a decent cost.  Can't afford the private gyms in Jefferson county.
YafttQ9v,"The long term costs of operating and maintaining an aquatic facility have not been appropriately conducted and communicated to residents. The County does not have the appropriate number of residents to support the operation and maintenance of such a facility. In addition, the Aquatic Team is recommending constructing a facility at a low cost - which is the cheapest - and which in the long run would have greater long term maintenance costs. This project would burden the County with long term management and maintenance costs, and burden the residents with additional taxes."
A9Ci1FAw,Scuba Diving lessons would be amazing!
QIfL0HNZ,Too ambitious project for our small area.
lGCK7Hiq,"In my years here, I've never used Mountainview.  It's not how I choose to exercise.  I might be tempted to try out another pool, in Port Townsend.  I understand the value of placing the pool more centrally, but I'm 99% sure I would never go out to Hadlock.  I think the pool would be valuable to the area.  However, as I'm getting older, soon to retire, I am not enthused about increasing my tax obligations for an amenity I won't use."
EBC4R0eX,I had no interest in the pool when it was going to be in PT but I support the proposed location next to Chimacum school and would use the facility.
4cCYdY6B,i dont think we should build a new pool.
yYCKCrfT,Very excited about this possibility
FZCiBmPi,"while I answered the questions for my older household, and would not use the children's programs, I wholeheartedly support providing more recourses for children and young families. I am willing to pay extra taxes for this to be available to young families, even if I do not directly benefit."
EZCKe5MO,"Thank you so much for considering a new pool! My family would love to swim more regularly and I would be so relieved to know that my children could learn to swim here. The current pool has not met our needs due to closures, restrictions in lesson availability, and the fact that it is too cold for me to swim with my children. I hope that you will consider a warmer saltwater pool with some fun play structures like the Port Angeles Aquatic Center so that kids want to visit frequently and learn the skills they need!"
3dffpUNV,I already have access to a community pool in Port Ludlow.
nKCKtDk0,"County cannot afford to take care of what it already has, so building a very expensive facility that cannot take in enough for O&M is just going to make that situation worse.  Take care of roads and sewer and existing parks first."
onCYFgye,I'm tired of paying for everyone else's stuff If you want it PAY FOR IT YOUR SELF
noDTg1In,"Is there a less regressive form of tax that could be used to fund this facility? I support the idea of a pool. This survey doesn't give the opportunity to share how often our family used the pool when our kids were younger. Although I would use it less now , I support the pool for the children in our county. I would support the .02% sales tax if I knew other forms of taxation were ruled out. How about a tax on new home sales? or short term rentals"
mxC49omD,"There’s a lot of things that would be nice to have in our small cash strapped community. While City utility infrastructure crumbles, City roads go back to nature, and the City continues to misprioritize and flounder in what capital work that is accomplished, we unfortunately cannot afford to build and maintain an aquatic center while also advocating for affordable housing."
uaB6S3co,I love the idea of an outdoor pool and a climbing wall! Thank you for working on this!
huCizUTt,Any pool built needs to be privately funded. We should be looking for businesses to help sponsor this.
EnC4c2Mg,At this point in time finances are a huge struggle for most so adding to the tax burden is not fair
6pDTLZBn,"Take care of parks you already have. County is too small to afford this facility. It will cost a fortune to maintain after a few years. User fees won’t cover the costs. Grants don’t pay for maintenance. Focus on supporting basic services first like roads and sewer. Look what happened to city streets. Can’t fix those, then community can’t afford a pool. Pretty basic math. Will the pool get the same maintenance treatment as the streets got?  History says yes. County roads good but also now struggling for adequate funding. Pool will ultimately compete for funds with everything else the county already has. How long will the 1890s courthouse building last?  Is someone working on that?"
iPCYwgNv,"What's most important to me is that all my patients have access to a decent pool (non-chlorine) to maintain fitness (classes, individual swimming/water walking, etc.). If it's not chlorinated, I'd be able to use it as well and help with patients' rehab (I am a Water Safety Instructor, excellent swimmer besides a PT)"
9UEB5zTZ,"It would be great if this facility offered what the Y and the Rec center aren't equipped to offer here but do offer in many other communities - fitness/yoga/exercise classes, affordable weight room/gym access, community event space, aquatic classes, swim team and open/lap swim times, dance classes, rock climbing, childcare, locker rooms, hot tub/sauna, and job opportunities."
1aB6uq77,Stop spending money during an economic downturn.  Have some physical responsibility. Fix our infrastructure and cut costs of redundant or unnecessary programs.   No one can afford this fix the old pool and have someone else manage it.    There were more than one bid that was workable.
rWklp3Nx,"I feel the process was not transparent, so I have no trust in this new pool/ facility. I will not use it if the YMCA is involved, due to how they treated a PT member. I believe the cost is too high."
rXCi6TZ2,"To me, this is no different than many other ""expenses"" that I pay for but never use. While I don't begrudge schools (I have no children), at least I view that as an investment in the future of our community. I don't see a parallel comparison with this aquatic facility.   I am, however, glad that the location was moved from PT to a more central site, so that those in South County were taken into consideration. When people are trying to be environmentally aware, driving 25 miles one-way to PT from Quilcene just to swim might not be popular. Besides, we have one of the best natural swimming locations right here - our own Quilcene Bay!"
REDTIdbW,What about a surf /wave facility to aid in learning?
RGCKXOcz,"I support a pool and changing rooms with showers but not an ""aquatic center "". The latter is too expensive for this county. Why try impose extra costs on a community where many people are struggling to pay rent and buy food? It seems outrageous to me."
EVCK3HzC,"Whenever I see the existing pool now, I think of all the waste. ""Outlived its useful life"" means it's now going to be a mountain of garbage, and I wonder about that. Do we not think it wise to bring a more reuse/recycle mindset to these assets? Additionally, I hope people bring a conservative attitude to the new project--these are public resources we're talking about, and I would love to see respectful custodianship of these resources, starting with how the new facility is designed and built. It's already expensive enough, living here! Where and how will the workers of said aquatic facility be able to live, while the wealthy residents whose bills are all paid use the facility?"
HoDTXSWE,Build it!
PTf7JNFH,"Spend the money on affordable housing, parking for workers and visitors (not another hotel!), streets, and infrastructure needs."
ZxC4zbKh,Children need to know how to swim.   It is our duty as a community to make sure they have a safe place to learn this life saving skill.
JHDTduhH,"I fully support a new pool facility, especially one that includes the other recreational/community building opportunities that you listed.  I also fully support the Port Hadlock location, as it provides more equitable access to facilities to a greater portion of the JeffCo population.  Swimming is key to many people's health and wellness routines, especially those with limited mobility and/or those who are a part of the aging population.  Also, equitable access to affordable swim lessons is a key safety aspect for both children and adults.  We are surrounded by water here, so having the opportunity to learn how to swim is key to safety and builds strength and confidence in young people."
k5EB8J4n,"This is a needless expense!  For the cost of the pool, you can more than afford a wetsuit for every person in Jefferson County so they can enjoy swimming in our local salt water!"
m7B6nayv,Having another gym area would be a huge help for our local youth sports.
Y5CKXgHF,How frequently will the bus from PT go to the new location? Will the new location be part of a Y membership? Would be nice for bus circuit to run every hour from PT
Kdk5igRG,Workout room would be nice. Gyms here are too expensive!
IOCKGwAg,Natural lighting
4SDT1oxP,none
mQB6O1w2,"Thank you. This would be a wonderful amenity to our area. Sequim and Bainbridge Island are a long drive in order to swim. We have considered purchasing a lot in Port Ludlow just to have their pool available to us. This would be a better solution. What would the cost be to use this facility, mainly the pool?"
IRkJfhvA,Gymnasium
2JCKXp1B,"Thank you for continuing to work towards trying to get a pool built in Jefferson County, it would be a great resource for many. :) Being in the water is so healing, hope you end up getting the support you need to move forward!"
cLfyEh1K,Why are we using our taxes to support this.  We can barely make ends meet as it is!!  Stop taxing us to death in WA State
QvCYlRUr,"Needs to be in Port Townsend, then I'd support tax dollars. Why not set up a salt water facility by the shore? Manny places do."
P6DTpYYK,"I think a Port Hadlock facility would be VERY INCONVENIENT for PT residents, especially the older crowd.  Again, VERY INCONVENIENT.  Keep it here!!"
2xCKfoIf,"Any change to a Port Townsend location, rather than central county, is a complete non-starter in my opinion."
KmCKsS5C,We love water slides and water emitters too!
NuCiYqsG,Definitely support this!
XHkBGyRT,"Although our household would not use youth classes,we support including all youth activities regarding the pool."
1xf9bkXZ,"Hello! I currently care for my dad part-time in cape george but hope to someday move to PT and fingers crossed, have my own kids. I am so excited about the idea of them having a great pool, as swimming was important to me when i grew up. I am delighted that Hadlock is the proposed location, as that area needs more love! I wish that we could do something to support it monetarily that wasn't sales tax, because it is so regressive and hurts working class families. I wish there could be a tax on vacation rentals etc. I know that's probably not feasible."
aHkK57LB,The existing facilities in PT need to be renovated with a lot less cost as an existing study which was commissioned showed.
1oCKuDCz,"I would use facility 4-5x week, at a minimum."
gtCKWWN9,"For daily lap swimmers, a heated pool is essential! The population of the JeffCo could become healthier and better connected socially.  This is important."
XtCYKrwr,Thanks for all the work you are putting into this project.
DfkxvAk1,"My husband and I do not want a new pool in the county, regardless of where it will be. We  do not want to pay for this, we do not want more traffic or congestion in Hadlock/Chimacum, and we feel strongly that we should not be required to pay for this facility."
LwC4zZ9V,"It was originally estimated $10 million to repair Mountain View pool. I don’t condone $30 million for a pool farther away. We don’t need all of those other things, either. It is too expensive and too much debt. Just fix the old pool. We have a budget deficit. Roads need fixing,. People who don’t use the pool much shouldn’t have to pay taxes for one."
RBDTDilI,The county has far more urgent needs than this.
99CicFak,I think there are many other needs in the community that outway an expensive pool.
kjC46zP8,We do not have a large enough population to support a pool. We do not have the money. We do not need nor want another new organization with the authority to tax.
N9B6TFbq,We'd also likely utilize the pool when our grandchild visits/stays with us from out of county.
8hkOR8sT,"If it was more of a “YMCA”/ community center not just a pool, I would be more willing to put more money to it. Especially indoor pickleball."
MFC43sqb,Much better location for south county residents than Port Townsend.
HwCiBrsY,"It's hard for me to understand why I have to pay for others recreation. If I used the facility, I would expect to pay for use and not be subsidized by tax payers who may not use the facility. Simply put, If folks want this, they should expect to ""pay for use"" and not rely on tax payers who don't use the facility. If there is so much support for this, then it shouldn't be an issue to privatize it and leave the local tax payers out of it."
UWEBuFsm,I am very excited about this possibility! I would love to have a more convenient and modern pool option in the County
ezDTEzmF,"This is very exciting. As we have aged, our physical health exercises are much more likely to be done in warm water and therefore healthier.  I’m sure even younger people would benefit too."
ddCKB3Iz,"Truthfully, I don’t think I would use it being in Port Hadlock since I live in Port Townsend"
JVCKTn5W,"Please move forward quick, before the Mountain View pool breaks again."
N2CKjamW,Mostly lap swimming and fitness classes
6QCK2gpG,Get it done!& Stop wasting money on consultants and surveys
lKCYnVP5,Yes!!! Do it!!!
82EB2GBQ,"I don't support the facility in ""East Jefferson County"" for several reasons. The bulk of the population in in PT. People purposefully come to PT for services, schools (including from CSD), jobs and more. Far fewer people go to Hadlock for such purposes. More kids do not live ""out in the county"" as I hear some saying. CSD is very small compared to PTSD. Port Ludlow has 3 pools so including their population in the number of people within a 15/20 minute radius inflates the actual usage. There is a small part of the radius number than is just as close to Sequim so take them out of the equation too. The increase in carbon emissions needs to be considered too. I get why people live ""out in the county"" for bigger lots, less expensive (sometimes) housing, and closer to Kitsap/Seattle/Sequim. I used to live ""out in the county"" and had a nicer house with a better view but purposefully chose to live closer to schools and services.  I won't be a jerk and put up ""No Pool for County"" signs and I understand the County has full control of the situation now. If it winds up in Hadlock, do not blow it. Build two tanks MINIMUM. Don't cheap out. Build a Bainbridge or Wm Shore-like pool. Don't copy Sequim or NK. A single pool would be a terrible idea."
hwfkDewi,"This is a selfish waste of money and material for the very few who will use this facility -- yet increasing the tax burden for all. For those so committed, perhaps they should gather their resources and build a privately-funded pool."
V5C4E26k,I support a pool to build community
D2DTEn53,"Even though I wouldn't use the facility, I would happily pay additional for families to have a fun place to go."
1bCKZdrv,"Though we no longer have young children or teens, we work for Chimacum School District and see a long, overdue need for this recreation center for families in Jefferson County."
srkszHTg,"Repair the roads (among many other badly needed things that would benefit more people) before chasing this silly, misguided, hideously expensive pipe dream. What a waste!"
kDDTnT15,yes please and soon
tHCKW4Ho,Affordable access to swimming lessons offered at reasonable times for working parents are very important to the safety of the kids in our community.  I hope the pool will be affordable or free to give access to everyone.
KFCYSeUq,"They couldn’t maintain the first one properly our concern here right now is getting these roads fixed. The roads are an absolute disaster, dangerous have cost me two sets of tires"
zskW5CTp,It will be a good addition for the county and good location.  I am concerned with overall costs and if the planning/construction can be done in stages so we can all be behind the project and get at least a replacement pool in the future.
BefFvClW,"Make sure there are lap swimming and a separate exercise area and separate swim areas for kids, possibly a floating play area. A hot tub would be nice as well as a sauna. Adequate changing areas."
QZkb3OGq,"The facility should have solar on the building, and it should be installed by a local JeffCo solar installer like Cascadia Solar!"
9yCYhp1g,"I heard there will be a $20 million bond and cost could be as high as $40 million. For that kind of money, I’d prefer that we support our young people and families by offering enrichment programs. We need programs to keep and bring in younger people and families. $20 million can provide a lot of programming."
5SkJUBff,"Of course would love to have all the perks ie weight room, classes  etc. However if biting off more than our county can chew and it fails I would be glad having an efficient working centrally located pool.  I’ve been going to Mountain View pool close to 30 yrs driving from Port Hadlock.  Inside city limit pool goers can do the same it’s not that much of a stretch. I hope it can be supported throughout the county."
2CCKDIOh,I do not feel the County can afford this. We have bigger problems to solve such as affordable housing and homelessness
FbDT5r5n,It would be nice to have a pool close to home for when grandchildren come to stay for a few days.  Also nice for me to on occasion go to pool to swim.
g7CiZRcB,"i have been waterwalking in pools, etc in many countries the best ones have moving water you walk against ( i like to walk against it when it is up to my neck). 86 degrees warm is nice. note: should children(grand and great grand) visit me I would take them daily to the pool..thank you.,                     0. 86 degrees warm is nice!!"
Hmf4kVw3,very supportive
cZB6J7ew,"The needs of our community do not justify the money being discussed for a new pool. Your survey encourages delusions of grandeur, a cheap trick. Please develop a  less expensive plan in keeping with all county needs not just your pet project."
jSCK49so,"I’m very excited for this eventuality and grateful for all your efforts! The pool is a prime need considering that we are surrounded by water here.  There is a lot of energy around cold-plunging and it’s great health benefits - it would be a great complement to hot tubs & sauna if it could be included as well in the dream list to make it more accessible to folks.  Also, I know it’s a long shot, but there are a lot of kids who are looking for a good place to play soccer (both indoor and out), especially in the off-season when HJ Carroll is too soggy to use. An indoor facility and/or an outdoor artificial turf field would really benefit our local athletes, who have to travel to Clallam and Kitsap counties for good league opportunities.   Keep up the great work! Thank you"
eQCisGLc,"In the present times when we struggle to maintain what we have, I'm for spending whatever is necessary to upgrade the mountain view pool than build new facility wherever it might be in the county; I sure it would be much, much cheaper than a new aquatic center. As a retired contractor i agree that present pool could be restored for many more years of use. We  have a small group of comfortably well off folks who would like to see something grand, but to me, it's the tail wagging the dog. If occasionally inconvenienced by a maintenance shut down , so be it, we'll get over it"
2hB6bxaq,For the future of this greater community I believe an aquatic center for all age groups is very important
EZCiLPTv,"These are extremely uncertain times in every way imaginable and then some.  The county has many more important unmet needs.  I am not for this plan at all, would vote against it, and would speak with others to also vote against it."
raEBbXR7,Maximize efficient use of tax dollars. Do not gold-plate the facility.
7DkmIjOH,It's too far from my home to make it practical on a regular basis.
nhDTuBEJ,"Although I might not utilize the pool myself, I think it’s a very important community asset in attracting and retaining younger workers and their families.  Who wants to work in a community that can’t even provide aquatic activities for their kids?  Given our proximity to salt water for boating, kayaking, etc.  swimming and water safety instructions should be readily available and affordable for young and old alike.  It’s irresponsible not to.   Also to be taken into consideration are public transportation options and regular schedules that will make it quick and easy to get to the pool without driving.  Having it located near the library is perfect:  we can dip into the pool and into our favorite books on the same trip.  Thanks and best wishes in helping make this a reality!"
5pCKFtFX,"It is imperative that a maritime community like ours provides a resource like this for education, wellness and enrichment for all ages in our community. We strongly support the need for a new facility - thank you for your efforts.  I hope that a new aquatic facility would partner with area schools to ensure that every child learns to swim at an early age, has opportunities to participate in water sports in middle and high school, and ensures that swimming and water sports are an accessible part of East Jefferson County residents throughout their lives. Similarly, I hope that such a facility would partner with Jefferson Healthcare and area health and social service agencies to ensure that adults and elders have access to activities that promote health, wellness and community interactions, including co-generation programs bringing youth and elders together."
8PDTIite,"Given the location, we are unlikely to use a new pool and would likely continue to use the one in Sequim or Port Angeles instead. This is a poorly conceived location that the community has been bullied into, when the most common sense approach would be to build a new pool on the site of the old pool."
3GEBEFSE,"I think this proposed facility has value for our county, but do not support its funding through a regressive sales tax. This should be funded through private donations."
cwDTxy2x,"I’d like to see information on the long term costs of maintaining such a facility versus just building it. Also the viability of looking for a private organization to partner with the country to build the facility and share the lion’s share of the costs for construction and operations. In a community as rural and spread apart like ours I have some real concerns about the viability of a government owned facility and the merits of the perceived need for one. At this point the county should probably be looking to tighten its purses strings and save tax increases for the things that actually matter like roads, police and fire departments."
J1C4k3N0,"If you build it, they will NOT come -- cost of living and taxes are already out of control. Jefferson county is poor - look at how many kids are on free meal programs Only the elite can afford the fees, but a lot of those live in Ludlow where there are already pools. This pool project is a total waste of time and public money. STOP it now."
UsfZMHkf,"My family drivers an hour most weekends to use the Shore Aquatic Center in Port Angeles because they have such a great and affordable facility, I would love to see something similar come to Jefferson County."
ugC4cYUp,I would use the pool if it were salt water
qXCYo9uz,Not worth the time to drive to Hadlock. Current pool is walkable distance for most of Port Townsend. Proposed pool is not realistically reachable by walking or bicycle. Forcing everyone to drive is a time burden that essentially eliminates it as an option.
OGkdKEPE,Fully support new pool for our region but keep it simple
Rqk3NY2C,"I would support it IF it did not increase my property taxes. If finding were secured through other means. I would prefer to see $ put into housing, schools and economic efforts, as well as climate change remediations and agriculture support. A pool just seems like a luxury given the current needs of our county."
kDDTX514,"Sales taxes are regressive, costing more for people who have less. How about a property tax option?"
HwCK7Wt7,"As a parent in Port Townsend raising a family among many other families here, it is important to us that the new aquatic facility be FUN!! We love the Bainbridge and PA pools because they have so many fun things for kids to do, along with places parents can connect and rejuvenate. They are packed with families and I know our local pool would be just as popular. I want to make sure that all the fun amenities don't get value-engineered out of the facility design because the older generation have a loud voice and don't plan to use those amenities. If we end up with a lap swim and swim team pool only that isn't fun for kids of all ages, I don't think our family or other families will use it and that will be a huge missed opportunity. Please keep the fun and we're super excited to support this pool initiative. Its high time we had a new pool! Thank you for all your hard work."
vNfRsFCy,A lot of people in PT will not drive to Hadlock which takes out a large portion of the user base. Second it is already really expensive living here and a lot of working class families are struggling to make ends meet. Let's not burden them any more.
zhfHzirn,"I WILL NOT support a facility that allows men in women’s locker rooms, women’s showers, women-only activities, etc.  That’s the reason I do not support the Port Townsend pool, because they allow men posing as women in women-only spaces.  The PT pool policy is an affront to WOMEN.  The policy there creates an offensive, unsafe environment for women & girls.  I am willing to support an aquatic center that provides exclusive spaces for women & girls.  Men pretending to be women need to use the men’s facilities.  If you will not commit to providing locker room & shower facilities for women & girls, that exclude men regardless of what they identify as, then I absolutely DO NOT  and WILL NOT support this facility or any increase in sales tax/public funding."
TPEBigan,1. Youth swimming lessons should be part of school curriculum in this boat & water community. 2. Pool should accommodate High School Swim Team workouts and competitions.
FzCidCmx,Stick to the basics to keep costs down and it actually happens
RNC4WeSF,I don’t use the swimming pool in Port Townsend since they banned Julie Jaman. That is when it came to my attention that men/boys are allowed in the women’s showers and dressing rooms. This practice is wrong on so many levels. Men who dress as women are not women. I suspect any new facility will have a women ONLY  shower and dressing room.  A men’s ONLY dressing and shower and  a “whatever you call it “ dressing room and shower.   NO NEW TAX FOR POOL!
XsCisjh6,"Should include stationary bikes, weight lifting, stretching mats, pool should have warm water sections."
85kKvTL8,Store county records and Law Enforcement evidence
rRkQ5V3A,As we transition our living to our home in NorthBeach neighborhood (retirement) we know we would great appreciate and benefit from a modern multipurpose aquatic center. In the near term while part time residents will also enjoy this facility.
sTDTGGgH,"With people paying more for daily life needs, adding a new government tax seems foolish.Giving it to a  NGO to run is foolish and then charging the tax payers a fee to use a facility they already will be paying for is foolish."
5UEB35rD,"There are more pressing needs for our tax dollars than building an expensive aquatic park for a select and elite few. Our family has zero interest in an aquatic park, even our kids and their friends think it's a joke."
hFB6w7sz,We live in Brinnon and early classes would not work at all for us.  They would have to be afternoon classes and most are not.
b3CKAjme,deferred infrastructure maintenance  should be top spending priority.
yIfoacX6,"Before the pandemic I participated in water aerobics at the Mountain View pool three days a week. My husband did lap swimming a similar number of days per week. I have not been back since, unfortunately. The women's locker room is way too crowded, the pool is often closed for various reasons, and my preferred instructor no longer works there. The Hadlock location would be much more convenient for us. Please do not suggest building the Taj Mahal. Please just build a pool with the core requirements. Too many Jeff Co. residents won't vote to pay for it. We will, enthusiastically, but those ""no PT pool tax"" signs are real."
SeDTrj9G,No transgender workers!!! Or men in women’s locker room.  THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEXS MALE AND FEMALE!!!  Keep transgenders out of women’s spaces!!!!!!!!!!
T7CiJU0e,We desperately need a nice pool! I’m tired of driving to Sequim! And we need the gym too
SYEBN71B,"AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A FAR, FAR GREATER NEED FOR THE COMMUNITY."
aGCK8Lo7,Biologically born males only in men’s locker/rest rooms! Biologically born females only in women’s locker/rest rooms!
dJfEJH3B,It looks like the proposed aquatic center will be much more than just an aquatic center. When people are fighting to make financial ends meet the last thing we need is more taxes for an aquatic center that may be used by a very small fraction of our population. Please stop this nonsense.
h4CivxKt,"It should be an aquatic facility only, especially if there has to be a new tax to pay for it.  Anything more encroaches on the many private opportunities available.  And no, i have no investment, financial or otherwise, in any gym or anything else. We will not vote for a tax to build a multi-use recreation facility, only an aquatic facility."
PoCYSzKi,I would support a 0.2% sales tax to fund road maintenance. Until the roads are well maintained we cannot also afford a very expensive aquatic center. They closed the gym in PT the other day when it snowed because the roof is so bad they’re afraid of the snow load. What evidence is there that a new aquatic center will be taken care of any better?
1vC45OqK,No
LnCKGppT,I don't support the idea and will definitely vote against taxes for it.
JCB6CzrW,"An aquatic center(pool) AND a community center for classes, etc is the optimal combination to provide needed recreation and general revenue to be self supporting."
Y8C4gQlm,"While my household would not be a heavy user, it is a great idea.  A facility like this is needed for the youth and young adults, and those with families.   Don’t mind paying taxes for a facility that serves the whole county and not just PT.  Some PT people might even learn that the county is also a great place."
KJCieUqB,"I have heard much muttering that too little space has been left for lap swimmers who have had to wait in line for available lanes. Can a balance of usage be sorted so lap swimmers  can rely on regular, reliable access?"
4pCiwV8w,Would really love to have a weight room w cardio machines.
LyEBpRFm,We have too many VITAL infrastructure needs in Jefferson County to talk about more than the pool at this time.
jWEBtDcm,I am chemically sensitive so chlorine would be a limiting factor.
KOCK5PUa,"Since funding will be difficult I would like to see a facility that focuses on swimming in the pool, for the community and the schools.  Adding extras like programs that don't use the pool could come later."
ZdCickQL,"Retired and elderly. Exorbitant property taxes to accommodate very few able to access an aquatic facility. Fix your problems in Jefferson County, before encumbering the residents in Jefferson County with another boondoggle. Think Cherry Street!"
8XkoJdvj,"Make sure the pool length meets national competition requirements. I lived on the Island of Hawaii and the bureaucrats built a pool with the expectation of having national competitions in the community of West Hawaii. The problem occurred that with insufficient input from National Swimming Associations the pool was built a little too short. This meant that no competitions resulted in accurate times so no competitive events ever occured after spending all the money required for a great pool! When building the pool it is a must that the dimensions meet national requirements for competitive events - otherwise do not waste money on an expensive paddling pool! I'm not sure how many people living within Port Townsend will drive to Port Hadlock to use a swimming pool. I would use a recreation center if built in Port Townsend, but not the pool. They are two different things and attract a different clientele."
9sDT4ZiE,"The current pool cannot find lifeguards to staff the pool full time.  This is because PT has become too expensive to live in (there is no affordable housing). By affordable I mean housing that people earning $17 - $25/hr can actually ""afford"" to live in  Raising funds for the pool through increased taxes will raise the cost of living here (sales taxes and property taxes in particular).   If property taxes continue to rise RENTAL HOUSING RATES WILL go up in order to cover owner expenses.  We are already in a housing crisis in this town - store owners, restaurants and other small businesses all have help wanted signs out.  They cannot find people to work in this town for $17 - $18 or even $25 per hour because it will not cover housing costs (rarely do these positions offer Full Time employment)  PT's demographic is largely well off retired people who want services - WHAT HAPPENS when all the services have to close because they can no longer be staffed because people can't afford to live here? WHAT HAPPENS when we build a pool, incur massive debt and we cannot open the doors because we cannot find dependable people to come to work everyday for $17 - $25 per hour?    A facelift for our pool would be nice, an Aquatic Center? I think not, save those huge projects for Seattle where they have the population size to support it - financially, staffing and for use."
93B6GWjJ,"The aquatic center has been voted down twice.  The first time because it was an obvious money grab by the controllers of Port Townsend and the Jefferson county commissioners.  The second time was because, even though the County Commissioners reluctantly considered building the aquatic center elsewhere than Port Townsend, all that was done by the proponents was to change the color of lipstick on that pig.   Now, we are supposed to believe that the replacements of the people who gave us the Cherry street debacle, forced the Prop One initiative in 2017 to give them access to grant money, and have totally mismanaged all other funding initiatives are finally telling us the truth, and we should be happy to pay for an aquatic center which will be of benefit to less than 5% of the population of this county.   I do not choose to fall into this trap.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  John Gusoskey."
pWCKAVDK,"Please, no pool tax!"
fCk5ngQA,"While a pool proposal is nice, I strongly believe that it'd be better to invest in upgrading Mountain View pool instead. I ride my bicycle to the pool and will certainly never do that to go to Port Hadlock. That'd be a major loss for Port Townsend."
TyCiQKuo,"I have the impression that a small vocal minority is trying to impose their desires on the entire county population. If you want an aquatic center, get a private entity to build it, and pay membership fees. Don't use public funds."
3TCYxLVg,Thank you for doing this.  The positive resource this can be for our community is unmeasurable.
cIkUY5wB,Great location choice that makes facility accessible to ALL of Jefferson County.  Jefferson Transit has said they will adjust their routes to meet the needs of the community. Our schools need a regulation sized pool for the swim teams.
nvDTSDt8,We hope it will be built and has lap swimming
dmB6V81y,Good decision on location.  Our schools need a place to have swim team practice and children's swim programs.  Our youth needs more exercise. I'm a senior and I would love to participate in senior aquatic programs.
yFCiA4P7,"I visited a swimming pool in Lynnwood with my little grandson and the facility had wonderful ladders and slides for toddlers with shallow water. I would love to see  elements appropriate for little children. They also had a ""river"" of water that people could walk or swim through. That was fun. My grandson would visit to go to the pool here with us. I used to visit the pool in Sequim where I enjoyed the hot tub area. It was social and very nice for relieving body aches and such. Even though I most likely would not personally use elements in a facility designed for teens I would love to see those things. I'm not sure what they love these days, but perhaps a game room might be nice for them with foosball, pool, chess, checkers, etc. Exercise equipment could be included in the teen area or in a separate space. Entering a pool can be hard on old legs. It would be nice to have some stair entrances to some of the swim areas. I LOVE the idea of indoor pickleball."
oJCYcz7d,"swimming is a joy as well as an exercise.  I would go to Mountain View much more often if it wasn't a 30+ minute drive each way.   As an older person, swimming has become increasingly an exercise/activity that really helps me keep in shape and feeling good.  A new pool with better access would also allow more kids to learn to swim and more families access to water-based activities year-round."
Z2C4v6BJ,In addition to using the facilities in numerous ways I would also VOLUNTEER for youth programs to support the center and my community.
VfB6mwvl,I support youth activites and facilities being incorporated into the desgin even though I answered no use from my household (no children in household). There are so few indoor facilities for youth in our community.  This is an unmet need.
hjEBu5Xt,"An aquatic center is a big-city amenity which, with our small population and even smaller tax base, we simply cannot afford. If there is demand, it should be met by the private sector, not by a government program that forces me to pay for something I will never use."
A9kIw32J,"While we might not be a frequent user of the facilities, we do believe that this is important for those with families in our community."
GcCiEOdZ,Waste of money. Already pay to many and high taxes and fees for seniors to live in this county.
z4B6rjRK,The Hadlock location is a deal breaker for me. Too far to have to go in my senior years. Mountain View is the best location and could be redone for less than a new facility in Hadlock. Probably would hardly ever use in Hadlock.
7JC4A1Vr,"I do not support a county wide pool tax … there is plenty of money to support it in a town like Port Townsend (for example), not necessarily a place like Coyle (for example). There should be an alternative way to fund it."
VqC4cMku,"Build a damn pool not an absurd recreation facility. Those who will generate revenue should pay. $5,000 donation is not enough to have your name listed as a supporter/owner/investor. Hospitol and port and Y need to pony up$"
rAfnGAXf,Carry on!
KRCKKAmo,The facility not matter the location must be accessible for al users. That means open evenings and weekends. Prior to moving to PT we were avid swimmers both recreationally and competitively. Due to the lack of hours available for a working fault we have used the pool twice in two years. Very disappointing the level of service. There should also be a shuttle from PT to the new location so teens and other non drivers without transport can use the facility
hUB6akiE,"Lap swimming with reserved times, meaning you do not have to share the lane, are most important to my family. Serious swimmers cannot share a lane, which is why we do not use Mountain View."
lsDTs4lr,When I lived in Port Angeles I used the heated therapy pool and heated whirlpool as a Member of Shore Aquatic Pool! I'd love to see that here to provide physical therapy for my bad back!
S5B6Gj9A,A new county pool would enhance the quality of life for county residents in so many ways. It would be such a boon for the area.
xlDT23et,There are many higher priority concerns for our extended tax base
6xC4Pgk0,Thank you!
4CEB3lBF,lots of old people need it for the only exercise they can do with their fragile bodies
XFB6VePS,I think it’s very important to the community for all age groups to have a working pool.
DNCY8ab3,There are lakes and salt water all around us we do not need new taxes to pay for something the masses wont use.
V2DTsdnm,"I have developed a chlorine allergy, so I would dearly love a saline or other non-chlorinated pool"
63C4Qzqd,"Although I would love to see an Aquatic center built, as a resident inside PT’s city, I don’t see myself traveling to use the facility unless it was in walking distance or there was a safe way to cycle there. Also, with all the vital services that need attention and our tax money, plus no way to know with the current administration what stability there will be with social security payments, I consider this aquatic center more of a “want” than a “need”. Finally, I think this project should be put on hold until we see how much we all will need to tighten our financial belts with all the current federal budget slashing."
uEk9eOr2,An aquatic center would be a huge asset to our community's health and well being!
95EBR2L6,"I’m very disappointed that this survey does not allow us to promote activities that we think are important to the community but that we may not participate in. An example would be children’s swim lessons. I have a little granddaughter that lives here that really needs these, but because you are only asking what I would use, there is no way in the survey to tell you that I support it."
R7B6oKWS,Out of all the non aquatic activities rock climbing would be the most important to me
mpf3LdhL,Water slide!!
c2CKeZgH,I don't want it. I don't need it. Only have people who are wanting it to pay for it and use it.
r2kxqQSo,Thank you for asking for our input.
RbC40Vrp,Thanks
KFCY6fqL,I think it is a waste of taxpayer money. Often decisions made for the betterment of the county disregard the feelings of taxpayers in south county.
GkB6jjF3,"My wife & I very much support plans for a new County aquatic center.  Though we'd rather see it located within or closer to Port Townsend, we understand and supprt the need to locate it more centrally in East Jefferson County.  Still, the increased distance will reduce the number of times per week that we visit.  A separate diving well would be fun."
LGDTBrO4,Jefferson county hasn't the population yet to tax and provide continuing funding for this project.
exC4eWco,A weight room and modern exercise equipment should be included.
taEBRQ8E,Understand need for new pool- tax is too high. Would support lower as am taxed enough by county
OCEBNJLI,"We need a new aquaric center.iving near a body of water makes it necessary. Swimming is a LIFE SKILL and children especially,  must have the means and opportunity to learn it well."
ygCKAsGz,"Please keep in in a budget that we can afford, but this is very exciting.  If the pool water can be other than chlorinated, we'll be more likely to use it.  That's why we don't use the current Port Townsend pool."
imB6Vknu,Find some other way than raising everyone’s sales tax.
zACYmXWn,There are many more important infrastructure needs in the county at this time.
JnCYv9s5,I would like to have a private facility considered  for taking on the business venture of an aquatic center.
zTEBa7HQ,people who work in our community need housing more than a pool
m1EBBmmH,Is there bus service from Port Townsend to get there or will you have to own a car to use this pool?
2KCiqNEx,"While my children are now grown, there is immense value in providing family and teen resources to our county. Our young people comment that they feel left out when considerations like this are being made. We must center the youth in our community if we want it to thrive."
uDCKoK4y,Facility is desperately needed in this area with very little resources for recreation. Especially in light of new housing opportunities in the Hadlock area in the future.
nICiIgYf,This proposed aquatic facility must be a voter approved project if you expect people to have their taxes raised to support it.
EhCYrGLm,I can hardly afford property tax . I live in fixed income
qQkSDHmb,"My answers on use are conditional upon the pool being a saltwater pool. I cannot tolerate chlorine.  Chlorine is a dealbreaker for me and I would be very disappointed. My physical therapist highly recommend swimming, but there is nowhere to do that safely for me."
R7B60n64,"I believe out tax dollars would be better suited to providing affordable housing, meals for homeless clothing drives for low income families. Lets remember that not everyone can afford another tax added to our already strained budgets.  There is so much beautiful outdoor recreation available here, get the kids outside and breathing fresh air. Lets get more creative with out thoughts on what recreation is. We don't need to keep up with the social media presence....Not everyone has 2 earners in their family. I suggest that money could go to hire more people for creating some more thoughtful organization at the public school levers.  I DO NOT SUPPORT INCREASED TAX TO PAY FOR A RECREATION CENTER"
XGfdy9cl,"I myself probably wouldn’t use it much, but I think it’s important for the community to have one, and I support it."
EzCK03aQ,"Pools are a great place to build community. It’s also incredibly important that people have a place to learn and practice swimming, being that Port Townsend is surrounded by water"
z0EBQX9m,Thank you for your time focusing to make this happen. It will benefit all ages and be good for our health and quality of life.
0zDTbcom,Try to get a pool with lanes at least 25 meters long to enable lap swimming.
MwDT0x2R,Build as much as possible with the funds that the community can support. Pools are the hub of a community. This facility will provide one of the best opportunities for our county to support family recreation in our community.
kfkNzk0H,Asap
mLkzXMq4,I would try to use the pool 2x per week and/or exercise the same amount. I am over 80 and ability changes week to week. We need a pool for everyone—young people and seniors.
dYB6QFLh,"I'm a PT resident and am SO in favor of the new location in the county, rather than in PT. We need more equitably distributed resources in JeffCo! It's literally less than a 10 minute drive for me to get to the new location & I'll spend more time than that looking for my keys before I leave the house. Moving the facility out of town in no way inconveniences me and makes it more accessible to others. Seems like a great solution."
seCifAtu,"I think that there are more pressing needs that would be a better use of tax dollars.  I can't afford a sales tax increase, especially for a facility that I won't use."
LODTxCp2,"We recently started using the pool and changing/ showering rooms. The pool seems to be in very good condition, and the changing rooms are fine too. I don’t see anything wrong with it the way it is"
UnCidXU2,"Kids need more activities in this county.  The sooner this gets built, the better."
8TCYPv7k,NO POOL PLEASE
v7B6YKqC,"We are a small county.  There is no need for this pool to be built, especially at the estimated cost."
A3fQaEEr,"Building a county pool in Port Hadlock is too far away and inconvenient for frequent use.  I would much rather support a city pool in Port Townsend, to be funded by taxpayers who live in Port Townsend."
oGCKvQ0s,Please make this happen!  Hadlock is the perfect location!
06DT8bE1,"I'm much more interested in the non-aquatic aspects. If it bring folks together, and keeps people active, I think it's a positive thing."
JoB6T4BR,"Curious about the new survey--I remember taking one when the YMCA of Jeff Co. (Erica Delma was fabulous) was trying to spearhead a new pool. Are the other results too old? It seems like we are starting at square one again and it is just taking more time away from actively moving on a pool by starting at the survey level yet again. I know I'm preaching to the choir, but now my youngest child is 18 and none of my kids were able to utilize an aquatic recreation center in their youth because of the slow pace. It's vastly more expensive now and the hospital is no longer part of the stakeholders, so I'm quite sad at the lost opportunities because of the local government. Sigh. I guess that's life here, for ya...and part of the reason why my now young adult children live elsewhere. Nothing was keeping them here."
33C4l8qX,I would like to swim several times/week but don't drive so bus to Port Hadlock is not convenient.  Fitness swimming and swim lessons are my highest priority.
8KC4MHga,Just concerned about the cost.  Our community need sooo much and I don't know if an aquatic center is where the finances should  go first.  It's a dilemma for certain.
ewEBmEFF,"Just build the pool,  indoors.    Allow ground space for an outdoor pool or other expansion in the future.      Just get the pool[s] done and overwith.    Also,  DO keep the MountainView pool intact,   and fix it up [if it really needs fixing] in the future when money is available.  But mainly     get the Hadlock pool built."
WIC4Op8E,"I have read the proposal and feel renovations to the current pool would suffice. I beleive our county needs better roads, utilities, and should prioritize needs rather than wants of an aquatic center."
l2fqgjxV,Include an area with free weights for weight training.
HsCimOoQ,Not something the greater majority wants.  Something meant only for a select few.  A real shame!
YgB6QT55,"suggest private funding, not taxes"
Y0CKDRyW,"When I lived in Seattle, I’d routinely drive 20-30 minutes to reach a lovely outdoor pool in Magnolia, and 45-60 min to reach a stunning outdoor saltwater pool in the summer in West Seattle. When just seeking exercise, I’d drive 10-15 minutes to reach my local pool in Ballard year round. Therefore the outcry here of “No tax for PT pool” seems silly to me because we’re all so close here, when compared to Seattle. I would definitely use the pool in Chimacum, especially if there was a bus from PT."
dGCiQkcS,"Would the sales tax fund operation and maintenance of the aquatic center as well as construction? If not, how would those be funded?"
ZQCKckOb,"What do you mean by public showers? Would there not be a locker room with showers? Would there be a ""Buy in"" by the Hospital for renting time and space for therapeutics in the water or rooms? Make them contribute! There also should be more than one pool so that a kiddee pool can be happening for lessons while adults are in the other pool."
QrCYXtHm,"It is my opinion that the suggested location is more central to meet the needs of communities, younger families and a broader, vibrant  growing population."
reC4xf8E,"Private fundraising, and funding from the school district/hospital or any organization that would be using the pool on a regular basis. Why doesn't the YMCA help pay for a pool and a facility for their programs instead of earning from a pool? Aren't they a charitable organization?"
zNEBv0Ww,"This is possibly the worst time in the past several decades to be attempting this for such a small number of participants. I’m sorry for this poor timing but roads/sewer lines/water systems have to come first. Too many of our neighbors are struggling terribly financially as it is. It sounds like a small percentage but when you already are painfully strapped, any amount of additional taxation is crushing - financially & emotionally.  I believe a private fundraising is more in line - a foundation, etc - for such a small percentage of our community being served."
TJCYUEsx,"Let the people who actually use it pay for it, not use tax money! I am NOT interested in any pool anywhere!"
jBCYv6Af,I oppose a facility funded by a regressive tax. The gap between haves and have nots in this county is already wide and getting wider.
Ccfdwx1Q,Gym please
9tC4QsVQ,"This project can’t move forward without having employees able to work. For there to be employees working lifeguard shifts, the wages need to be competitive and liveable.  There needs to be forward thought on how you will find and keep employees for a facility like this. You might succeed in building it but what is your plan to staff it? Think ahead, please."
N0CKbdMs,We do not use the current pool because it is too cold-below recommended standards. A new pool must be warmer-meet recommended standards-for more people to use it. Most folks I know travel to Sequim or Port Angeles to use their pools.
lhCKfsRS,More lanes for lap swimming
lNCKETpa,Our property and sales tax are already too high.  If this cannot be funded with current tax revenue it should not be done.
PikdiFIu,I support programs that make life better for people even if I don’t personally use them. We are all connected!
HUCYG08u,All children need to learn water safety/how to swim.  Should include a shallower pool for small children that can be at a warmer temperature .
CxfF94LU,I would like to use the pool for personal fitness. I think it’s important we have a pool so kids can learn to swim.
ndDTPUVu,Consider private funding options
BCCiZvOz,"We would use a Salt Water pool often, we will not use it much if it is chlorine."
fxB67yZM,I will only support this project if the cost is reasonable to our community. Better to go more simple and manageable than spend money on unnecessary amenities. I do love the central location. Thank you.
wTCYjumK,"I wouldn't use the facility for child care etc, but I fully support those aspects of a community center."
w9CYYCjB,"Much needed.  Location is excellent, particularly if public transportation provided to support usage."
ImB6XAc0,I'm very happy that you're considering a location in the Port hadlock area. I've been saying for 10 years or more that a location more central to East Jefferson County was more fair and accessible to all. Good job! I live in Port Townsend and have enjoyed having a pool in Port Townsend and would love to have one again but if this is going to be a county pool he in a place that everybody in East Jefferson County can use it.
mFkn4Grn,"Salt water pool please, thank you."
fSfgNFgG,"I have to imagine the proposed location was based on politics and not on a serious ring study.  Ring studies yield demographic information on population, household income, neighborhoods, infrastructure, and other key factors within a specific radius of a proposed site. Ring studies are used by retailers to select sites for stores and by landlords for setting rents.  One can only imagine that the more densely populated Port Townsend, with higher incomes and more leisure time, would generate higher usage (and revenue) than the less densely populated and lower income levels of Port Hadlock.  This project is almost guaranteed to be a huge fiscal drain on the public fisc, even with a supporting sales tax.  At any rate I refuse to vote for a sales tax for this ill-advised project."
GrCiBov0,"I am a teacher at Blue Heron Middle in PT. We use the pool downtown every year with our 7th graders for water safety and team training. Unfortunately, we weren't able to use the pool last year because the boiler needed repairs. We would love to have an updated rec and aqua center. The idea of having a gym, pool, jacuzzi and sauna with actually classes would be amazing. Classes and class times, as well as gym options are limited in PT city limits. We are excited for this possibility in Hadlock! This new facility would be about 5 minutes from our house, so we would use it 5-7 days per week."
XMEBK4Hb,I'd love a proper lap swimming pool! Short course (25m x 25m) or Long course (25m x 50m).
O3CYMu6U,I am a lifetime resident of Port Townsend and I truly believe that the aquatic center should be in the county to support everyone equally
kufYDFAn,"I'd rather see money used for more affordable housing, assisting people in need. Thank you for your interest in finding what works."
erB6gAHn,"I enjoyed swimming when younger, but in nature (lakes and bays). Never was a fan of pool swimming. An Aquatic Center would be nice, but so would a villa on the Med. I believe the cost would be prohibitive for a small population that would be served. The intent is worthy, but so are food banks and homeless shelters. As a tax payer, it is low on my priority list."
vzEBZjAf,I think it is important that the aquatics center be a tourist draw.
NECKPfIh,I hope the existing pool at the Mtn View /Pt T location will continue to function.  6 minute walk for me vs 20+ minute drive to Chimicum.  Might just excercise by walking rather than driving to a pool 20’ away.
jhkMTBEW,"Focus on the pool!   Don’t want the expense of all that other stuff…..just give us increased pool space.  Lived in a place that built a new pool center….had a pool for the kids and also large lap pooll …..it was perfect!   It would be noce to be able to go lap swimming at any time of the day, and not have to be in the same space as the kids."
wgCYRS9J,How about a joint daycare center that would provide jobs and all the extras go toward maintaining the pool and daycare center.
J2EBWpxq,"The wife and I don't use the current pool because it is in Port Townsend, but we would use it if it were built in Port Hadlock. We think you would get more from South County as well to justify the cost."
iVEBVWMX,I currently swim year round in my club’s outdoor pool 2-3 times a week. I have a disability and swimming provides a safe exercise regimen. Our swimming is what we will miss most when we move permanently to our new home in PT this summer. 100% supporters for building this new pool!
XICieYAa,"Please consider a fitness room with exercise machines, mats and weights.  A real steam room would be great. Also a bigger sauna.  Make a longer pool for laps."
WbfSc6qL,I am so looking forward to having a modern pool facility in Jeff Co.  I like the Port Hadlock location much more than the current and prior-proposed location.
MIkc7FE7,"I would likely vote for the sales tax because I think a functional pool is important for children, but I'd prefer a less regressive funding source, e.g. tourism or property tax."
LcEBJxkM,Complete waste of money and not supported by most of the county tax payers... only a few in town.
A4DTVZz7,"In this time of high inflation, financial insecurity/uncertainty, and misappropriation of funds within our town we do not currently need this. Please stop raising taxes and rent!"
91f8qlqN,It’s a great idea and I really hope it happens for our community!
flfuMVXd,An aquatic center is an essential part of a healthy community. Let’s go!
2jfoXpYG,"I support this idea and location and hope it gets a chance to happen, thanks for all your hard work!"
5bfNBglj,"I would totally love a new, clean and local pool.  I've grown up having to use the noisy Y pool and/or drive to Sequim to swim (great pool there).  This is so exciting to me & my Mom."
asfA3yrv,Maybe this could be paid for by subscription ?
zPCYgV6b,"Just build it. We ALL need it, especially those who think they don't need it."
DbfxtoKS,"In an ideal world, I would love a community wellness center (like the Kroc center in Coeur d’Alene, ID) that focused on overall health and also has a pool. I personally would love a gym and as a physician, I would love to hold patient group visits at a wellness center (such as diabetes prevention or management classes)."
hwEBzIu7,I would use a pool if it was in Hadlock. The port Townsend pool was too far and not inviting / appealing.
6zC497Lw,"Times are tough and getting tougher.  I wish things were like they were before and there was hope for things to get better and you could make normal plans.  To ignore how horrible things are going to get is foolhardy.  Good on you for persevering but I cannot support any kind of tax increase at this time.  As it is, we may have to sell our house and move because we cannot afford our property tax increases much longer.  Not sure where we could go, though..."
BSEBxfHW,Why can't the school districts obtain State educational funding to build a pool at one highschool?
xTC4AglJ,Thank You!
GtB6bbxE,Too far for the exercise.
3TCYJS5D,"AS AN ELDER WITH KNEE PAIN, HYDROTHERAPY IS CRUCIAL TO MY WELL BEING."
QSB6XCJg,Makes us health and lots of fun
OmEBpcKe,I think this is a wonderful potential option for the youth in our community!
YufPb88j,"Find Private, Donated sources of funding for this project, and then charge an entrance fee to pay for it.  This is how it used to be done.    The people who ""want"" to use this center can pay for it. Why do we always have to pay for programs of the few with taxation of all? !!!  This is mostly a low income and retirement community--our income is not going up, it's actually going down.  The most benefit/usage for this center will be the families/children, and yet you plan to squeeze the retirees.    Will this taxation also provide ""free"" transportation for those who can't drive (which are many, especially on Marrowstone Is) who wish to use the programs you want them to pay for?"
yQfBDiYR,I would urge you to do all you can to ensure that DEI principles are included in the process and implementation of this potential facility.  What are you going to do to ensure this space is welcome and inclusive to all?  How will you reach out to historically marginalized communities to ensure that they feel like this place is for them as well?  Reach out to them to help create this space with them in  mind. Please consider any environmental impact the building and maintenance of this facility might have.
vqfBtnkq,"Hope you find the right balance between function, beauty, and efficiency. Green and sustainable. Serving young, prime adult, and older community members would be great. Healthy environmental impact with minimal [no?] use of toxic substances. Renewable energy, too. Would love outdoor fitness stations on the pool/center grounds and a running path around it. Asking a lot, but that's the dream.Thanks."
MSEBILcR,"I understand the current Mountain View pool has exceeded its intended lifespan.  It is unfortunate that a building that is only 60 years old finds itself in that position; I have visited much larger aquatic facilities in Europe that are hundreds of years old.  Having a basic understanding of the costs of upgrading the mechanical systems at the current pool vs. breaking ground on an entirely new facility, I would prefer to see the current building upgraded.  I understand this would not provide the same level of accessibility and functionality that a new building would, but I do not believe it is worth the additional cost for the benefit of a small section of the population.  I had similar reservations about the new Salish Coast Elementary.  We are a small, rural county with a limited tax base outside the Port Townsend city limits. We do not have the revenue of our neighbors in Clallam county.  Our considerably higher-than-average per-capita tax burden is already not enough to maintain basic services such as sewer, roads and existing parks.  How will the new facility be maintained, when we are not able to maintain the facilities we already have? What will happen to the current pool? How much will it cost to repurpose that space in addition to building and maintaining an entirely new facility?  What about future pressures on our county's resources due to climate change? I strongly suggest we do everything possible to upgrade our current pool."
UTDTiAW2,Pool and A community center would be a great asset for the county and well worth paying a bit more in tax.
sXDTM8Kp,Though I would not use it much I think it is very important
FFC4dJDn,Another Jefferson County boondoggle and money request for a very few county persons. Charge the participants enough to cover the real cost of this facility.
gIfiMzxa,A stripped down aquatic center ( no extra services such as those listed) seems appropriate for the size and tax base of our community.
U0CYdaMQ,"Please take into account that those opposed to any tax increase are generally more angry and more vocal than those OK with a small tax increase.  I think the vocal opposition is a minority of the actual population.  I also think that the major beneficiaries of a new aquatic/recreation center are children.  We as a greater Jefferson County community need to do what is best long term for all the children, even children of the vocal minority who are against a small tax."
oxEBWOL8,"Really excited about potential for a new aquatic center! Having accommodations to make it easy, feel safe, feel welcoming for trans/non-binary youth (and adults) to change, shower, use the facilities would be game changing for some individuals. Even having a progress flag, or a large “ally” sign can make someone feel safe enough to use a space. This may be more important now than ever before"
EbC4s9mC,If the funding is from grants or government that’s fine. My taxes are high enough
KfCYd1S0,I think the county has many more urgent problems than building a new aquatic center and that the money would be best directed elsewhere: roads; affordable housing; public transportation
sIDTLRpz,I like the Silverdale Y with the lap pool and the zero entry/lazy river pool separate. I like the Bremerton Y pool and the PT pool because they have bleacher/seating area for viewing lessons/swim events.  An inside gym and outside play area would also be welcome but in a difficult funding environment I think it best to focus on the pool facilities and make the building plans flexible enough for future additions/expansions into other uses.
t7B63nMy,There needs to be a far better appeal to the County than what I've seen thus far.  Just a County location is meaningless if the thing doesn't add significantly to the value of Jefferson life!
E9C4QRON,Keep it in the county and do not let Port Townsend mayor or city council have any involvement.
g6C4TaU1,We have serious infrastructure issues that should be addressed before committing resources to a project that the majority of people in the county will never use.
3gB6p7OS,I just want to keep Mountain View operating. I would support a tax increase to fix and moderately expand pool size. I will not support any plan that closes Mountain View pool. Let’s just do a Port Townsend only tax to fix local pool.
AKB6mB1F,"With all due respect, with property taxes, gas taxes, power, gas and food expenses hitting all new heights, it seems that a new facility is something we really can't afford.  If it is going to be built it should be financed by the people using it not just property owners who face rising property taxes every year.  Many of us can no longer afford to live here let alone finance even more follies that most people won't use and those who do feel that they should be able to without bearing any of the financial burden."
VMCKuFLA,I just hope this happens sooner rather than later.
zXCKJcdh,"Stick to the obvious priorities that benefit our citizens. Once those priorities are more fully addressed, perhaps reconsider if this project."
SnC4UxbP,Do it. It is important to the community.
D9CK8AsR,Adult swims would be nice on a regular basis
qJfX6aGr,"Our family (two adults, two young children) would love to see a new aquatic AND recreation center. We used to live in Seattle and visited our local recreation center almost every week. This is something that is missing on the Peninsula that we would be happy to support as we know that it will be a fun place for our kids to visit when they get older and as myself and my partner age."
GjEBWa3p,Salt water pool would be great!   Water needs to be warm -- similar to PA pool -- for folks with kids to use the pool regularly.   My 13 year old son is a very poor swimmer because all the water around here was too cold to learn to swim -- Mountain View Pool and natural salt water.
wrB6TyQY,It’s nice to dream - but one hopes that reality kicks in before getting too far down the wrong path.
4hkzisCj,"Based on materials provided, there is no mention of non aquatic facilities/program, yet survey asks about additional rec center activities.  The focus should be on a community recreation facility that has a pool, not just an aquatic center.  This appeals to me more and I think it would have broader appeal to JeffCO residents as well than just calling it an aquatic facility.  I miss the community rec centers in towns in Colorado where I used to live."
m4Cir6AA,Stop spending money on projects we don’t need.  How is the aquatic center in Sequim funding itself and what is its participation rate.  I disagree with the pt proposal 100%.  The cost of living is growing faster than our income can support.  Stop the spending on feel good programs and projects.
F5koKuwl,"too expensive, reduce costs"
1gCYBGPX,I think we need a pool but I think they are overdoing it with all these other services and the cost is too high!
Z9CiL456,Coordinate more public transportation  to and from pool with JT
qZEBNRqg,With economic decline looming on the horizon this is not the time to raise taxes on recreational facilities
0NkBeIci,"The location in Port Hadlock is too small. We need a real recreational center that accommodates other indoor recreation besides swimming. This requires sufficient parking. Given how much open space the county owns in East Jefferson, it is disappointing that one of the smallest locations was selected. There will be no room to expand the facility to accommodate other recreations"
3PC4XXPZ,I am trained in aquatic therapies and would love a new pool that could support the needs of our community!
u4B6MUfZ,Thank you; we desperately need a new pool. Having to drive to port Angeles to experience a quality pool is a huge drain time and money wise. Thank you; let’s get this done!
DGkxqLF1,please consider a salt water option as strong chemical smell and residue on skin is not only unpleasant but toxic. i otherwise will not go and i know many others who will also not go bc of this very important detail.
yACKanGz,"My biggest concern is the Millions it takes to create this. We are in Unprecedented times and financially, many in our county are having a hard go. The appropriations of valuable funds needs to stay grounded in reality. What serves the most people in our county? A pool?  I fear I will not be able to afford to live within the city limits in a few years already.  My final piece is about transparency   Hiring a company, spending money, without due process is upsetting to say the least. It feels like an in-club, where a few make huge profit. Not ok. We want others to bid and throw in ideas on a project of this size. Period. There will be hell to pay with the public if you don’t. I’m sure the Seattle designer is salivating over no completion."
I3CiROyA,"I'd like to see a retracting roof over at least part of the waterpark area.  I find an indoor pool nauseating with its muggy chlorine atmosphere.  Areas to lounge in the sun during warmer months, would be nice too."
rWkJ96Hw,I prefer salt water instead of chlorine to ensure a less toxic environment and natural body products in soap dispensers to ensure health
ipC4px9w,"I would love to take my future kids to this pool in the next decade. I would love to send my kids to swim lessons and other clubs and sports. Growing up here, it would be a dream come true to see a facility like this in our county. i strongly support the location being in Hadlock."
brC44E2z,Indoor soccer field for year round soccer! Bowling Turf field for soccer outside.
6HB634oW,Need to scale down to an affordable facility. Property taxes high and unmanageable for retired people
y4B67EVp,This would be so beneficial especially for the elders and children of our community. Its supports the health of the whole.
TwCiGzXw,"Keep this project focused on a practical set of services. We are not Bainbridge Island, we are not Bellevue, we are not Medina. We need a high quality aquatic facility for young people to compete and for everyone to use for health and fitness. We do not need party rooms, we do not need spa facilities, we do not need transgender facilities."
Ovka2qtE,"Would be happy to pay a tax but not quite so much. I love the idea of a pool. I do appreciate the current location. If there was a pool, I’d be more inclined to use it."
BjkyFLuf,"I wish there was a way for people who live far away in Jefferson County from the proposed pool location, like in Brinnon, to not have to pay for the pool and/or for people living far away to get free public transport to the pool."
gECYwM0T,My request is that this pool utilize the same salt technologies that Shore Center in PA uses.  This would be of great benefit to everyone's health and well-being.  (As in NOT using the traditional straight chlorine methods)
WnEBlxBI,Even though I am a senior with limited use for myself I would very strongly support this for children and youth in the area. Please make sure not only construction but operation and maintenance costs are carefully considered and not underestimated.
6qki0Vav,"I am disappointed with the location (not in the densest part of our county - the City of Port Townsend) and the tactics used by those who favor a Hadlock location, ""no County tax for a city pool"" campaign.  We now have a County pool to be funded with a city tax.  Should city residents put out similar signs, ""no City tax for a county pool?""  I predict a ""no"" campaign like that won't happen.  Not because a tit-for-tat response isn't justified, but because PT residents believe in public funding for public facilities that benefit our residents.  I am disappointed with how the County Commissioners have handled this project.  Pools are hard to operate and pay for.  I think the location is risky for operational reasons.  It will be interesting to see if city residents will be willing to travel to Port Hadlock to use the facilities.  If this facility were located in the City I think it would have more usage and would be more likely to be financially successful.  How this has been handled has only increased city vs. out of city resident tensions.  It could have been handled better.  I wish you luck."
7pC4d3Uj,Best wishes.
k5fgonG2,We are worried about the cost of the pool given the low number of households in Jefferson County.
67CYx51a,"Workout room with weights, cable machines, treadmill, and stairmaters. Family changing areas, such as Bainbridge Aquatic Center. They don't use large changing areas."
AsfAc6Bp,This facility must be affordable. Gym/pool memberships are too expensive and it limits my access to exercise in the winter. There should either be an affordable membership or an option for low-income scholarships like the Y offers.
xLC4QqJY,"Very excited about having a place like this I can actually afford to use! I live in Port Ludlow, but not in an HOA, so cannot afford the outrageous fees the Club charges nonmembers to use their facilities. I would also be interested in a weight room. A small theater with a stage for local groups to use would also be great."
D5C4x5xE,"I am excited for this new aquatic center!  I support this. I am 60 yrs old and used to compete when I lived in Enumclaw when I was younger. I am a grandma and looking forward to teaching my granddaughter learn how to swim and all the fun activities offer for little ones. (she is 17 months old now). I look forward to going to the Aquatic center often. I love swimming and water, and I have been hoping to have Aquatic center like Sequim but closer to home. I live in Port Townsend. So, thank you for making this possible. I support this."
FokNgina,"Got voted down last year why is it still on the table,"
0LCiYeGE,I do not support a pool only option. The County needs a real recreational facility that attracts a larger number of county members and offers a variety of recreational/fitneess/health options.Not good enough to offer a pool first and recreation center later
61kQGHZW,Remodeling the Port townsend pool facility would be more cost effective and doing an expansion to the already available site a more efficient solution..
u9kHI5E5,Im a supporter
cKCK8SY7,Prefer that it be built in Port Townsend.
Ugk9NF8S,Not appropriate for a small recreation or a medium size recreation center in Jefferson County. There are many other projects that would benefit from tax dollars such as County Road improvements and more public housing that people could afford that live and work here.. frankly a very stupid idea.
YQCKOhLV,Indoor walking/running track.
Y8CKDBuM,"1.  I would use the facility more if it were within city limits, but I understand that there is no perfect place.    2.  Pools in Sequim and Port Angeles are excellent - JCAC should consult with those who built it and/or run these pools for information about costs, programming, etc.  3.  When citing usage of the current PT pool, please ask yourself if people (like me) would use it more, if it were cleaner, safer, more accessible.  4.  We should coordinate with county transportation to provide bus service for folks in PT who might not drive, but need a way to get to the pool.  5.  We should see if there's a way to promote bicycling from PT to the pool on the LS trail or other?"
HUkbwglw,Sad to not have easy access to pool
C1CYLod8,I’m happy the choice for location will serve the county residents.  The tri area bus system will need to be more frequent.
ljC4D6vF,The proposed pool is more expense than the community can support at this time.  It also appears to underestimate the ongoing costs
rmB6NuJR,All my answers are based on & hoping that this plan is for a salt water pool like in Port Angeles. I cannot & would change my answers if it is chlorine.
HsCYYNHX,Can't afford a membership to a pool.
rWCYLF8v,I LOVE swimming and am happy with the pool we already have but I guess I understand we need something new.  It is important for everyone to know how to swim.  Especially in our waterfront communities.  Thanx.
OdCi5UNn,"With two kids in elementary school, I would absolutely love to see a new rec center. I grew up in the Lynnwood/Edmonds area and the rec center truly was a centerpoint of my youth and I think this would play a huge part in the lives of kids and adults in our area."
A8B6BXk0,If it is possible I would recommend 25 yard x25 meter pool to accommodate water polo for high school teams and of course swim team competitions
miC4Zq2d,"This is a long shot, but any possibility of a salt water pool? So much more pleasant to swim in, than a traditional pool"
DSC4TM85,I have lived in this community over 35 years and feel our moneys could be better applied to infrastructure needs like roads and housing. Costs to live here have escalated so much for the long term residents we need to address that first.
MMC4t7Qx,"I love the direction right now.  I would have traveled to Port. Townsend for the same idea no problem.  The location idea sounds grand to me and it's been warmed over by the local elementary school _ which will benefit regardless.  It is a (2) win.  This region would accept a new pool so fast.  Port Townsend had their moment and it was botched for several reasons.  If a new pool had been there I would have supported it whole heart.  The community surrounding the Library and the School is a great place.. With the land inquiry and the Elementary School approval _ and the update on the local systems,  I cannot think of a better plan playing out ! That said, if it happens, remember the k.i.s.s. rule. Make it sweet but not over complicated.   6--8 lane 25* pool, spa for cool down.  Make it for real people - there's a high school down the road and little kids who don't want to learn to swim in icy salt water like i did . Make it slightly bigger than needed at first for periodic growth. You could consider a side pool ( dive pool) that would be worthy of a dive board, and auxiliary stuff like any kind of training.   It would be excellent though -- Look at the layout at Hazen in Renton.  Full pool with a deep water side spot.  Just my $02.  I Care about this.  You will hear my voice again.  Good stuff!"
3QEBCHN9,"Please, Please emphasis the Non Aquatic Recreational features!!.. This should be much more emphasized in your promotion and out reach!!!… People don’t realize this is about a Recreation center!!… a lot of people don’t swim so they will not support it if they think it is JUST a pool,  but would use the non aquatic facilities and classes!! and rent space!!! if they knew it was a recreation Center!!!!!!!!"
duCiYYxX,"I live in town and ride my bike to the pool multiple times per week.  A pool in Hadlock wouldn’t allow that, and I would use it less than currently.  I would like a pool in PT.  New or keep the current one open.  Or make two new pools.  Pool should have a hot tub and weight room/fitness room."
LUEBjeWj,"I am a lap swimmer.  I need a 25 or 50 yd. pool at the appropriate temp., regular and consistent “lap only” hours, 7 days a week, and a CLEAN locker room with hot water.  The PT pool offers none of this.   I have been in pools world wide that offer the above without a second thought.  Surely that can be accomplished here.  The location is 1/2 hr. away (only 10 min closer than Sequim) for the majority of seniors, hospital rehab patients and school kids.  I understand that this county is spread out but the concentration of people are in PT.   Please try to not enter into the political situation that the PT pool has with a city that doesn’t that care about swimmers and pool upkeep."
kRCiX1X7,This proposed project is a ridiculous waste of money we do not have just so supposed community leaders can sit at the cool kids’ table and be surrounded by head bobbers.  Very sad we are not represented by people with common sense and fiscal responsibility.
pqDTjCDi,I will never support a tax increase for items that are not a priority or necessary
CxC4A5iV,Fix the old pool.  Less money  and it will work fine
AVCYxM6N,"Considering what is happening in this country today, we should be more interested in making sure that everyone has food, shelter and clothing.  If federal funding is withheld by the current resident of the White House, we should not be spending money on a pool.  Jefferson County is a huge county and a pool in Port Hadlock will not be convenient for a lot of the residents. Let's not be asking people for more tax revenue when some people may soon be unemployed."
wCfvbUia,"There should be dedicated times for lap swimming, during which the pool would not be used for other activities. It's not worth building a new facility if user charges won't cover the bulk of the operating costs."
lQDTzJAe,I went through much of the information on the pool that I found online. The vast majority of people who want the pool live in Port Townsend. Can’t believe you chose Hadlock. Most people want the lap pool and warm water recreation pool not all the extras you seem to be adding. The number of people filling out the surveys is very small ( a little over a thousand). I continue to be amazed how money is spent in our area. The salaries of city and county officials are exorbitantly high. How about repaving the streets in Port Townsend?  They are horrible. Looking at the studies that have been done on the pool over the years I wonder how much money has already been spent on it and who paid for that?  Thanks for having the survey.
TXkc1lu0,"Jefferson Conty should be getting ready to fund the Trump admen defunding of Food, Medicare and education."
AQC4TTiD,We might use the AC when our families visit from Seattle or out of state.
iMCYeDPr,"The county needs this facility to happen.  I am hoping that there could be ""matching"" funding between our local philantropists and county taxpayers to construct and maintain our dream of a comprehensive community facility. Our present demographics and economy is hardpressed to add more tax burden on its citizens. As our population is expected to grow, our needs for infrastructure should come first. Access to the proposed property will probably require a roundabout on Rhody Drive, for instance.   There's a lot more infrastructure that needs to take place if we are going to flourish as a community with it's expected growth and needs.  My answers to this survey would be very different if I still had my family living here. Alas. I am a Senior on Soc Sec  living in my home. More tax would hurt, yes, but I also support city/county pride and commitment for our future families!"
ifCYkSrl,There needs to be more detailed information about construction and operation costs and usage fees. Will we be able to keep it open? Suggest studying Sequim aquatic center experience.
l5CixaHA,"We already have very high sales tax in this county & l don't think that people who will never use the facility should have to pay for it. With everything rising in price right now, a higher sales tax will only hurt people on low incomes. I also expect there will be monetary charges for use of the facilities & classes. While l feel this could be a nice asset to the community, the folks that want it  & intend to use it should figure put how to cover the cost."
VXfTye2u,"The sewage system in the county and better education for our children are better ways to spend our county,s money."
3UCKFLqE,Please make this a salt water pool.
B2B6Xc5s,must have services and activity for ALL ages
KnCiU7XQ,No taxes for a facility that will be used by a TINY percentage of residents. Plenty of pool opportunities at existing infrastructure for those inclined. Absolutely against this and everyone I've talked with. I am in the target demographic for this and I'm strongly opposed to wasting a single penny on this.
ViCi1U6d,Are boys who ID as girls going to be allowed to use the girls locker room? Why don’t you use the increase in property taxes received when you changed how you calculate home values to finance your pool. I’m about taxed out.
28EBGs3e,Thanks for your efforts. It would be nice if the facility had space for community non-profits to meet at a low cost. This would have the potential to reduce vehicle traffic for folks that live in east county and for PT residents who could combine meetings with a workout before or after their meetings.
cIB6sPEm,"Please install a saltwater pool, or any option that doesn’t require chlorine penetrating into our children’s bodies all day…  Also: Steam rooms are so much healthier and enjoyable than a dry sauna. Please consider this option heavily.  Thank you!"
b6CY9jyn,"I think that this is a ludicrous thing to be taking up the voters time and attention when we should be focusing on protecting our community from literal nazis. But okay. I don’t see why poisoning water with chlorine, thus poisoning your children is fun for you, but if you want to so bad just dunk some in their bath at home. Don’t make the town pay for it."
2ykr2b5e,How about you fix the old pool which was gonna cost a small fraction of a new center and lower our property taxes it is getting harder to afford to live here. If you just keep raising it all you’re going to have is a bunch of old retired people that are rich you’ll have no one else to actually work all the services for the county. stop the spending.
8WCYQPVP,Although I don’t have young adults in my household I work with them.  Ensuring their FREE access to a pool and gym would be an incredible benefit to young people and ultimately to our community.  Also including childcare and pre-k programs are in incredible need.    Thank you!
zVDTri72,"The facility needs to be built in Hadlock, a neutral location for all schools to benefit"
A4fpI9M0,As a young family we feel like this is a nice to have but not a must-have. There are a lot of ways once we're able to take advantage of all the wonderful things that Port Townsend has to offer.
rTCYbkyh,WE CAN NOT AFFORD IT!  It will only service a very small percent of JC residents and is insane to burden all of us with more taxes to cover it.
odCiA18W,Fix the potholes in the roads then talk to me about the superfluity of the proposed pool.
juCiBz0X,We have an upcoming recycling crisis and the county wants to build a glorious rec center to benefit a few people. This is the same ridiculous grandiose thinking that drove the failed PDA at Fort Warden. If there is not enough funding and interest for a YMCA type rec center how can there be enough funding and need to run a glorious public rec center?
j0CKSYUL,Universal gym room would be good for strength training
rNCYfBnY,"An aquatic facility is a must in Jeff County. I would very much use the facility to swim laps and engage in other water activities. Also living in a county surrounded by water we need to have a state of the art new pool so all of the children in our communities have access to safe, educational, life-saving swim lessons. This aquatic facility is a must for Jeff County. The children of our communities deserve the same access to swim lessons and water sports as the kids in the cities. Living in a rural area should not preclude the children of Jeff County from learning how to correctly swim. Also water based physical therapy will benefit all ages young and old. Please make this happen for the benefit off all ages in Jeff County. Thank you"
CQB6RJDm,I fully support the building of an aquatic and recreation facility in EJC. I would use it as often as possible for water aerobics and stretching classes for my advanced age of 77. And the youth NEED to learn to swim in this community surrounded by water! And for healthy recreation. We need this facility for all age groups.
mQCYRahK,"I would strongly advise that you consult with other communities that have pools/aquatic complexes. I know that Sequim had a lot of hard lessons to learn. I think they started offering memberships that you could renew at the same rate that you started the membership. They did not increase the amount paid for family with each passing year, so the early birds were able to cruise by, then the facility became financially unstable. I think the important thing is the swimming pool. Other activities may be encouraged to occur in other venues, like the Chimacum School complex. Be sure there's enough parking, too. My husband used to be a long distance swimmer but due to shoulder issues has had to stop. I also think it's very important to children that they learn how to swim at an early age. Thank you for allowing us to have input, Jack and Johanna"
KZfcS8uR,"I'm sorry to see it leave Port Townsend where, I think, the largest population of users live."
VPf2tDvj,you and i know the county and city will over spend any limits and it will be in the RED always.
yNCYHZ8f,curious how long the tax would be in place. is it permanent? or time-limited
E1feaTz1,Even though we do not have any little ones in our family at this time - I would have used it when my kids were small and think it is important for young families.  I would reluctantly  support the increased sales tax but Port Townsend’s sales tax is already 9.4% so that would make our sales tax extremely high.   Thank you for your efforts.
OeEBhLet,"I think a public acquatic/rec ctr is a high value for any community that can sustain it, thinking of others, esp my family who are not part of my household. But...I might stop swimming laps if it's not in PT. Just fact."
gDCKgQ3j,"Really hope to see this happen!  As a family with young children, having a modern pool would absolutely be a huge benefit for us in the community.  It makes sense to have somewhere quality where local children can learn to swim given our area’s orientation to the water, boating, etc. Safety and local culture call for a place for children to learn to to navigate the water."
jLDTI2la,Fix the old pool and bring it up to usefulness standards. Don’t build a new one.
kcfYzqrx,Yes!! I answered that I would not use youth after school care or kids programs because I don’t have young kids but I think they are very much needed and would support financially anyway I can.
AFC4Mvfe,Update the current facility in port townsend   This would be more cost effective   A Hadlock location would even further isolate Forks residents from using the pool while expecting them to pay for it
EHEB876k,Very supportive of this endeavor.  Thanks very much.
OwB6SrCN,it’s absurd that there is NOTHING of quality in terms of an “aquatic center” to aid in resident preparedness in water sports and wellness of ALL citizens. People need to make a decision and integrate taxes to make it happen!!! Wayyyy overdue!
BBCK17PZ,This facility is so needed for our community. It has been frustrating that my child has had such limited opportunities to learn and practice water safety and confident swimming. We have almost completely switched to having to rely on out of county pools (40 minutes to an hour away) to swim which has hindered our ability to swim as regularly as she needs.
ViCY4sPb,I swam laps several times a week when I lived in Seattle. Unfortunately the current pool is not inviting. I would definitely support and attend a new facility.
JCkfXidW,Do not spend taxpayer dollars to do this. Property taxpayers are already taxed to the hilt. If people want an aquatic center they should join a private one.
m1DT2KMB,"I would only be able to use the facility were it salt water/UV, etc., sanitized. Breathing and bathing in chlorine is injurious to my health.  May very well be injurious to everyone, even if tolerated."
1VCKmkq4,We need to put all the money into an aqua  center nothing eles as water benefits totally the entire population more than one pool warm water for old and young cool for lap swimming this is a birth to death and all disabilities EVERYONE  no matter who we can talk 360 301 3655
jLC4tUbs,I feel that those households whom would use such facilities should bear the tax burden. Those of us whom would never use a new aquatic and recreation facility should not have to pay.
0DC41rFC,Hopefully you’re not using public funds for the survey… We do not need another pool at the expense of the taxpayers in Port Townsend
BaB6FoJr,"It seems to me that this will happen no matter how many people are against it. And we probably do need an upgrade, though I’m very sorry the old pool cannot be rehabilitated. .2% is not a “small” tax. The sales tax in PT and Jefferson Co. Is already a lot.  I have always voted to fund community efforts like this, but so much debt and too many eyes bigger than stomachs around here these days. And paying for growth that I do not want to encourage.  Sorry to be such a downer, but the growth in this area and the way it’s happening, disturbs me."
4ZCihdub,Basic items like roads and water transmission aren't covered so why go off on this luxury?
mHB6JLLV,"I like the location plan. In my mind it should be a large enough pool area to hold competitions, thereby encouraging multi-county sports and additional revenue. Locker facilities should allow monthly rentals for regular users."
QUC4phs3,excited about planned location.
YDCKL6Le,Likely. Big user.
0WfuZElb,I strongly feel like the pool should be located in Port Townsend city limits. I think pools are so important for the community and that it will get the most use in town where it will be more accessible to a higher density population. Either way I support the pool. I do NOT think it should be in hadlock. I would support a pool there as well but think it is ill advised to have our county’s only pool in a rural area.
5GEB0SGn,"I would use a pool for water aerobics several times per week in a new facility. The PT pool is too small, too crowded and generally rather stinky so I never use it."
5bCYjLb5,On fixed income and don’t want or need anymore taxes or fees
GzEBxfvn,"Yes. I know it is old fashioned but I think and feel that it is VERY IMPORTANT to have a CLEAR policy regarding who uses which dressing room before the building is built.   As a woman I vote for dressing rooms for women and girls to be for human eings who were born with the traditional female physical characteristics that we associate with females. And vice versa for the dressing rooms for those with the male physical characterisitcs.  It is unfair especially to women to have to deal with humans who were not female at birth in a dressing room where we - especially the young -are vulnerable.  Let's return to the easier days when female dressing rooms were for those who were born with female genitalia and male dressing rooms were for those born with male genitalia.  I know that people have had surgeries to change their bodies. Maybe there has to be a policy for those people.  Perhaps the pool needs THREE dressing rooms.  I feel that a clear policy needs to be written and BEFORE the pool is built and opens.  I, for one, do not want to read about another kafuffel in the newspaper for months on end.  Let's make it easy for ourselves going forward!  Someones need to Think this through Now and make a policy that we can all live with.  I am rooting for you. Good luck!"
mGEBWWFj,"I don't feel this reflects things accurately and info has been missing, that would allow people to make an informed decision.  I believe an aquatic center is needed and wanted, for all ages.  We also need to remember all the grandparents here, that need activities for the grandkids (without breaking the bank).  In addition, other things have been on people's wish list, such as a bowling alley and skating rink (tired of going out of town with kids and grandkids).  What's the priority?  No one can pay more taxes and that needs to be heard.  We are broke and the wealthy ones in the community dont seem to contribute.   I suggest much better management of funds and the lack of that is a significant reason people will say no.  That and the fact that we haven't heard where funding will come from for ongoing maintenance and upgrades, operational expenses, etc.   More taxes?"
jzDTAeKo,Who will manage it? $.20 per $100????  No way
K6EBUl7r,"In the current political and economic environment it is irresponsible to fund a project with tax payer dollars that is not a basic and critical infrastructure project.  Furthermore, the project would primarily benefit residents of a limited geographic area while imposing the tax on everyone in the county."
j7EBbPVQ,"It is so important that our community have a good pool!!! We are surrounded on three sides by water and it’s such a big boating community, it’s essential that kids here grow up learning to swim! And with such an aging demographic, we absolutely need the exercise and physical therapy that a pool can offer.  P.S. the only reason I won’t use all the kid, teen and toddler programs is because my kids are grown and flown. We used the Mountain View pool regularly when they were growing up here — they both learned to swim there and my daughter did part of her scuba certification there."
IdCYxv44,Wonderful idea.
J5f27DM8,I believe we should have a pool for our county children to be able to learn swim and to be able to participate in official swim meets and for those others who would like a place to swim or recreation or for heath. I'm not for building a complete recreational facility.   We are a small populated county with many elders here who would more than likely not use any of the extra additions.  Plus the original $37million facility is far beyond our county folks pocketbook.  We need to be realistic and scale down!
yQC4u8kB,"It's essential for families to have access to a well-designed pool, swimming lessons and water sports especially during our long winters."
rpC4eOBl,"This area desperately needs a new pool. Thank you for your work on this. Politically it is very smart to move the location to Hadlock besides that is where it is most needed. Start small with intelligent planning to expand later. Keep it cheap so operations will be inexpensive.  Make it free to use or crazy cheap like a dime a day.   First build an outdoor un/ minimally heated pool. Make it really big with lots of space and lots of lanes. And open 24/7. If I can't find a time I can swim in a lane alone then the pool doesn’t make sense and no one will use it. And don’t forget the kids. Zero entry is awesome for babies and toddlers. Slides are fun for kids. Plus lots of 3 ish foot deep areas for playing. It should have free public showers for the truly homeless. Aka family changing rooms. Aka no more national news. Once that is up and running and everyone sees how great it is then expand into a full blown YMCA thing. Moses lake has a good example of an outdoor pool.   A sales tax is a bad way to fund it. They are regressive. Plus, The business folks will feel attacked and they will crush the effort.   Go for a Levy. Or a recreation district. Then you’ll see the true community support. I think it’s there. (Despite the rapid appearance of all those signs)."
fGC4P1Lh,I hope you have a swim team for adults. I would join a swim team.
ngC41Qnl,"I would be interested in fitness classes, especially for seniors, as well as other activities."
RsEBCACi,We would love to have a county based rec and aquatics center that has the ability to provide children and adult activities! Happy to pay into whatever is needed to make this happen. Could the PT golf course be another possible location that might bring more income generation from tourist use as well
qWC4Lm6T,"We really need a public pool and rec center!  Sad that in order to pass it has to be located way out in Hadlock. Better than not having one all. I hope after decades of trying to get this going, it’s might actually become a reality. There will always be a loud minority who are against anything. Don’t let them stop this again!!!!"
wkCKmHiC,"Being highly allergic to breathing chlorine, I cannot swim in indoor pools that use it.  Shore Memorial pool in Port Angeles uses bromine and salt so I can do extended lap swims there.  Extended lap swims are the only way left to me to do aerobic exercise, and therefore having access to unchlorinated water to swim in is a top priority for quality and length of my life!      An outdoor pool is ideal for me, as then I can breathe freely while lap swimming.  Lacking that, an indoor pool sanitized with bromine and salt is the next best option.      I swim in the sound when the temperature and the weather permit, but my body needs aerobic exercise everyday, and due to arthritis of my lower body, I cannot walk long distances, or quickly.      A pool I can swim laps in is essential to me and I can no longer drive to PA 3 times a week as I used to do.      However, a pool is not essential to life, and my husband and I are limited income, low income, fixed income seniors who are trying to hold onto our home in Port Townsend where the cost of everything is rising every day.      I worked as a Registered Nurse all my adult life, caring for disadvantaged children and families, and ANY regressive tax, such as a sales tax rise in these very, very difficult (for many) economic times would be a great burden on us and many others in our position.      As you can see, I desperately need a non-chlorinated pool for maintaining my health, or an outdoor pool where I can breathe non-chlorinated air, or a pool sanitized with chemically benign materials, or a salt water pool .  Also, chlorinated water is known to be toxic for children, as people from PA know.  Teachers at the schools there came to an early PT pool meeting a couple years ago and spoke about this.  That may be why the Shore Center closed for almost a year to rebuild their water sanitation system in order to exclude the use of toxic chlorine.      Please brainstorm funding sources other than regressive sales taxes that punish the poor even more than these tight economic times are doing already.      One idea I had recently is a sliding scale property tax that could begin on properties assessed at, say, $500,000 and go up from there, exempting all those whose property is assessed at less than $500,000.  Those  owning property assessed below $500,000 would be excluded from needing to pay any tax.      For those of us in difficult financial positions, any raise in our taxes for essential items like gasoline or all the other sales tax items means we need to eliminate buying more and more of those essential things.  It is unjust, and unfair.  Especially when there is so much money in property in this county.         We hope and pray you will come up with a way to finance this wonderful pool -- without all the extras -- and NOT on the backs of the poor!   Thank you for listening."
zYC4UXvy,I would not use a unless it is chlorine free. Chlorine makes my skin dry and itchy. I would prefer ultraviolet pool treatment. Chlorine is the one biggest factor in whether I would use the pool or not.
5GkXPWwg,"Even though we would not be using youth programs and childcare, I’m am fully in support of all youth programs. I would also like to senior aerobic programs."
FjDTgJVu,"If you build it, they will come!!"
kBB6nZag,"In our past experience in joining facilities such as this, they were so occupied by kid programs and events that facilities weren't available most of the time."
45C4yeHk,"I have asthma and would greatly appreciate a salt water pool, either outdoors or with excellent indoor ventilation. The less chemical exposure the better!"
09CY8mQz,It would make more sense for it to be in the city limits on the property the YMCA already uses. Most pools like this are in the city limits because of the access to utilities and other amenities.
LrEBa8am,Please please please DIVING BOARD!!!! The EJ Rivals Swim Team had a dive team this season. Many young people have talent in this area! Recreational OR competitive: diving would be a very cool feature for this aquatic center!
BIC4RY0R,Please please please  Salt water  No toxic chemicals to cause cancer please  Uv light   Otherwise it's just poison soup
w9fjhHOE,"I’m very sorry that greater consideration for the Mt. View site was not given more weight. Swimming lessons for our schoolchildren has been a great value to the health and safety of our community. The location has served the community well; I felt the golf course discussion upended and eclipsed the importance of a pool and community center in the city.  That said, I would support the construction of a new pool anywhere in the county!"
hoC4mje3,"I believe that siting a new aquatic and recreation facility in Port Hadlock does not serve county residents as well as it would in Port Townsend. Though a Hadlock facility would be more centrally located for county residents, the proposed site is a more difficult to access than if it were in Port Townsend.. This is because both the larger population base as well as workforce core is in Port Townsend. A much greater number of people on the road to make the trip down the highway will increase congestion and crashes, as well as deter many people, including myself and my wife who are avid swimmers, from using the facility. For those people who would walk or bicycle to the facility, they would also choose not to travel or cannot. Included in this group are children who would go to the facility on their own by bike or walk, but are unable to drive. Please reconsider this wrong headed decision that seems fair, but would be detrimental to the viability of the facility as well as fairness to the vast majority of users. Let’s be honest and admit that much of this decision was driven by a loud campaign of county residents whose motives are not in the best interest of a thriving community."
Q2CYgOFi,I wish we could build it in PT but I know it is controversial.
H2CY2s7X,Please keep Mt View open even if you build a new facility in Port Hadlock!
ovCKHVAX,"I think this center will help build community, invest in our youth and expand the options for families in the area. I like the idea of being able to gather, exercise, see neighbors, and stay healthier."
J7C4QjdM,I personally have a pool Asana and a hot tub. I would never use the facility. Nor am I so selfish as to expect my neighbors who are often very low and limited income to pay for such a luxury. This is a poor county because Jefferson county has failed to provide work opportunities. It would be far better to crowdfund this with voluntary donations and grants. It is absolutely unreasonable to put any more financial burden on the forest members of our society for something that is an absolute luxury
Hck9nCO5,"I think the City needs to focus on using our tax dollars more wisely. Less “egg-abouts,” “art,” & salary increases - more community type things. If our dollars were used better, I’d consider paying a tax towards things that support & better our community."
cJC4uLad,PLEASE!!!  DO NOT RAISE OUR TAX!!  IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA!  I DON'T WANT IT BEING IN PORT HADLOCK ANYWHERE BUT PORT HADLOCK PLEASE
M2fV8PgA,This is a terrible idea. The County cannot afford it and ongoing operating costs will add additional burdens
SVfD9BRZ,The old pool was/is associated with the YMCA. I see no mention of the YMCA with regards to the new pool? Please explain this. Thanks
85DTczxw,"Sauna!  Sauna!  Sauna!  Like, a real one!  Saunas have tremendous health benefits!  Look it up!"
G6B6t4BD,"We need a new pool, regulations size for the swim team and for meets to be here in our county. We need consistent water temps and a reliable pool.  I don’t want to mot feel the YMCA should be the managers of the facility as their pay is low and full time does NOT mean 4pm hours a week for full timers."
lqB6vMqU,Families in the area NEED this type of aquatic and recreational facility to support the many community services currently lacking to support children and families in the area. PLEASE build it!
73B69lVi,"We did use the pool for swim lessons when our daughter was young, and I value a pool for teaching people to swim."
t3EBfEnv,I'm having trouble seeing the necessity in this build as the Population of Jefferson County average age is 64 how this seems like a viable option for taxpayers. I personally think a Boys and Girls Club would be a smarter investment for the Community Mark Fuller 360-316-4711
2HC4myE0,"Please just build a swimming facility. We can add the other things later, or build them in a better spot. Kids need to learn to swim and have a chance to have fun in the water. Many adults would benefit from being able to use a pool also. All that other stuff would be nice if there were lots more people paying for it, but it's just us - Jefferson County is dinky. Just build a pool or it will take forever and tax people out of their homes. Leave the other things to private businesses, not public money, please."
d5k5rpmB,I think having Public showers and outside splash fun area for kids is it really important and would draw people in to use the whole facility like the pool or other programs/classes/café/meeting place.
uvC4CdkE,"Very excited to have an aquatic center so close and our family, and many families I know will use it frequently!"
2LCiT84M,"Why Hadlock and not PT? The majority of the money and users are in PT. Build a pool in PT, and a pool/recreation center in Port Hadlock."
pXfXjgjN,"My wife was a collegiate swimmer. She would be there multiple days a week swimming laps if it was located in Port Hadlock. Our 3 kids, all 5 and under, already love the water, but rarely get to swim. We go to Mystery Bay almost weekly through the summer, but the rest of the year, swimming is a rarity. Our family would be heavy users of a local pool. We were excited to get the new HJ Carroll playground, which we frequent multiple times a week and are excited with the prospect of having a community aquatic center close by. Having these kinds of facilities easily accessible for so many young families to enjoy, really gets me excited about the future of Chimacum and Port Hadlock."
bTC4cDbD,"I have been appalled at the behavior of the homo and trans phobic bigots pretending at fiscal conservatism to advance their bigotry and oppression. We need a new pool. In fact, we need perhaps three or four pools, one each in Chimacum, Port Townsend, Quilcene and west county. Yes to first world infrastructure and taxes to support it. No to the loud howl of prejudice!"
hjCYMhIU,"Great idea!!  We run out of ideas for things to do with the grandkids when they visit and I would love to swim regularly for exercise, way easier on old bones!!!"
9vCKOTaZ,"I don't think the city of Port Townsend should have to pay for something that the county wants.  If they can afford to put green astro turf on crossways then that money could be put towards the pool. Even though I live out in the county I would rather have something for seniors like myself to do. There's nothing out here at all and Port Townsend is starting to grow and we need to have something out here in Hadlock why should everybody be forced to go into port townsend? And maybe if you took away some of the money that the mayor gets since the mirror is getting paid that of the governor maybe that would help get you the pool that you desire.       Also there aren't enough programs for seniors and I'm not going to go to a pool where there's a bunch of kids playing and screaming and yelling I want to have quiet time if I go to a public pool and also I would like to have some senior time I don't feel like I should just have to go at 6:00 in the morning because that's the only time that they have it I don't think that's right. and you say you want to have these other classes I would be open to that but they're expensive and I'm not going to pay high money just to go there three times a month for $200. I would love to do Zumba and pilates and yoga but they're expensive.  So if the county wants to have a pool out in the county for Hadlock quilt scene Brennan then have it out in the county and with the new pool well I'm sure there's some money there just to keep it up to date. A public pool should be accessible to everyone not just a few but, you want people to pay taxes for it and they're not going to so that means they want to raise the house taxes well right now I am a senior living in a rented house and that could lose me my housing because the owners won't pay that they will sell the house so that's a big problem."
BiCYkE85,"If possible, please make it a 50-meter pool! Not only would it be the only one around, it could hold higher level swim meets and bring in people from all over the PNW. Local businesses and hotels would benefit too."
XCkINNdB,"I think it is important to plan programs with a vision of usage by groups of all ages and demographics and to think expansively about providing amenities that will bring people to the facility.  Don’t skimp!  I know money is hard to come by, but get some grants and make this place a shining jewel here in Jefferson County!"
2ZfKkG7T,"Many people have sensitivities to chlorine and the levels in the air at the Port Townsend pool are prohibitive to many people who would like to use the space. The Port Angeles pool is “saltwater” and works well- virtually no fumes, high ceiling and good ventilation. Please seriously consider modeling after the PA pool and use their decontamination system."
LfftjNJu,have pool access in Port Ludlow so not interested in funding another pool
S5DTHvJP,"I would love to take my granddaughter, now 5, to the pool on early release Wednesdays - possibly for swimming lessons."
PoB6KSmV,"the price tag is outrageous. Either rehab the YMCA pool, at a fraction of the cost, or work out arrangements with the Port Ludlow South Bay Community Association or the Ludlow Maintenance Commission, the Beach Club to use their facilities."
2IC4OhIY,Focus on swimming and programming for youth and don’t try to be something for everyone.
C6CKEFrH,No. My daughters pool is older that the PT pool and has been maintained. I fail to understand why the existing pool cannot be refurbished. Jefferson County does not need an Olympic quality swimming pool.
Z5kVI3ve,Pickleball would be awesome!  I don't believe there are any pickleball courts in Hadlock currently.  - icing on the cake for me!  Do not like MV Pool - and parents bring other gender kids into the open showers.  I do support this initiative!
bzCiqUTF,Need an updated gym.  Like a planet fitness
RiCir7Xz,Unnecessary. Waste of tax payer money compared to essential needs. See the statistics on the money drain pools due to heating costs. Let YMCA take care of swim needs. They have a business model. Counties shouldn’t try to get into this industry as they should take care of more pressing issues
rJkZsq0Q,A new aquatic and recreation facility would be most welcome to enhance the community and to provide myriad benefits to our citizens. Thank you.
0rC4sjP8,"As a Port Ludlow resident of 20 years, I have access to two pools at the Beach Club, which I never use and have to pay for in dues assessments. That is why I will not support tax increase.An additional pool is certainly not needed for many of us Port Ludlow residents, North and South."
j5B6CmFr,Would like to have a pool with less chlorine in it. It would be nice to have an alternative cleaning agent other than chlorine- so that your eyes and skin won’t burn and itch.
fkC4N6fD,"Too much money for too little use by a minimal  % of residents; yet, we would all be taxed.    NOT A SUPPORTER !"
77C4soVB,It’s a poor use of funding which only benefits a small group people and not the whole county.
RZC4jrfm,No new taxes.!!!!!  I would urge you to cut your budget and use those funds to retrofit the older pool.   Taxes always continue to rise no matter what.!!  NO NEW TAXES!
FtCiJofy,It’s a poor use of funding which only benefits a small group of people and not the whole county
19B6WNNU,Let PT rebuild their own pool with their own finances. The county does not need a new tax and a new pool
d1fDOuNm,Pool in hadlock does not provide opportunities on the west side of the county!
o8CKGCEv,"I vote in King County, but would probably use such a facility erratically.  However, I think it is extremely important to have such a facility available"
RHfsUvn2,"With so many needs in our county, such as the health and welfare of our residents,   Affordable care for the elderly, infrastructure issues, etc. I look at the aquatic center as a luxury facility that the well  to do have the time and the money to not only use but to support. In  these times of our uncertain economy, many folks do not need more  taxation."
9qCik6MS,"I support all of this and more only if paid through a progressive tax model.  If low income south county residents have to pay  more with the current state of the meager rapidly disintegrating social infrastructure, I say no.   I think of those who own second and third houses and Airbnbs. They don’t live full time or spend much money here while contributing to a housing crisis.  There should be a cost to this harm being done to the fabric of our communities.  With a sales tax increase, these well-to-do non-residents are not going to be contributing much of anything.  And what about the private entities like Rayonier who have been exploiting these lands and poisoning our communities for decades.  The wealth built and held in real estate here is vast.  Rayonier and Crown paper should be footing the bill for this kind of project but they aren’t going to be contributing at all with this tax.    A solution would be a progressive tax on people who own property that is valued above a million dollars. They are much less likely to be impacted by hundreds of extra dollars annually.  Whereas a family whose income is $40,000 and pays half of that for rent does not have a couple hundred dollars to spare. It is just directly adding to their poverty and debt.   Poor people are always the easiest to pull from as they have the least voice. Poor people are not the ones pushing for this pool, though many of us could use the services it would provide.   I think low income South County residents could come up with a long list of things they feel their taxation should afford their towns.  It would likely prioritize creating conditions that lead to safe and functional communities like sidewalks, crosswalks, a pharmacy, basic waste water infrastructure, affordable gas and groceries.    We want assurances that our towns and much loved places will be protected from the profiteers building luxury get aways while displacing us and our neighbors who have lived here for generations.  We don’t have that in Quilcene and Brinnon but we are paying the county more and more.   Personally I want to see this pool for my child but our family currently has very little free time and money for extra trips north to pay for enriching stuff.  And it won’t be much use for us in a future where we get priced out and have nowhere to live.  It is important to understand that at the moment the workers in the stores and laborers in the factories and trades are often working full time (or more) and many are not able to meet their basic needs for shelter, food, water, waste management and electricity.  As it stands the pool will be funded by regressive tax and then it will still cost money to use the facilities.  Wouldn’t it make sense to provide free access to low income folks?  These sorts of projects could be a great opportunity to try some new approaches to counteract the regressive WA tax structure that has contributed to the depressing state of our towns.    There are a lot of examples to pull from of projects like this that serve the entire community without further taxing the poor.    Do we have the will to push for the harder thing because it is right or will we stick to the status quo?"
dgC4gBSU,I don't think it is needed.... dollars should be spent on something for more people to use. Improve park areas and indoor event areas
nACKmHK6,Don't increase sales tax! We will take our business out of the county!
45fpQ8sW,"If the pleasant harbor resort gets built, there will be a pool available and I won’t be taxed to have it built."
EfCYet1U,I’d love to see a hot tub and pools for younger children please! Even better would be a workout gym with classes and childcare!
fLEBwKpJ,Fix your roads first
WdB6nrQj,You had better find another way of funding this project other than taxes
j6EB2uDF,If fancy expensive facility gets built then even more residents will be priced out of Jefferson County.
R9C4V4v7,I live in an HOA community with 2 pools.  Why would I want to fund a public pool? Those living in an HOA community with a pool should not have to fund this. The folks that want a community pool should pay for it.
UXB6F8W4,There is no aspect of this proposal I can support. We do not use or need any of these features.
kzC4ElcX,WE JUST WANT TO GO SWIMMING!!
xtk9Wlnv,Our community needs a modern facility!
yYEBHggA,"It would be wonderful to have straightforward, no nonsense functional and clean facility that would provide open swims and activities people of all ages."
1xkWYZkZ,"Please consider a therapy pool for children and persons with disabilities like the Bellevue Aquatic Center in Bellevue, Washington."
TRC47n7o,I think the money could be better spent somewhere else. Make do with what you have or have nothing at all
0VkmNUhe,No new taxes please.
33frA15l,No new taxes please.
CBEBd4Bh,Hope this happens!
JWfMAsYT,With today's economy I think this is a low priority for Jefferson County.  Maintaining what is already available is hard enough as it is.  Unless this is a competitive program used by schools the usage by the public would be small.
SFCYrESK,We would like to know what other funding mechanisms there are. It’s a great idea to locate it in Port Hadlock.
X7C4VKkY,This would be a wonderful addition to a growing community that wants more to do in the winter months. It also brings people together from all over the Jefferson County to build a stronger community with wellness in mind. Thank you!
jcB6ViSE,Salt water Not chemical water
0hfYFIX1,"One of the main reasons so many families go to Shore in PA  because of the minimal chlorination. Many are allergic to chlorine in the air and water in high concentration. For our family to use the aquatic center we’d need it to be salt vs heavy chlorine. It is so therapeutic and there is no reason we should be soaking in more toxic chemicals than we already are. Let’s make it clean AND therapeutic. The Mountain View pool made me sick and gave me a full body rash every time! So I had to send my kids to swim lessons in Bainbridge island and shore so that they could learn to swim. Meanwhile paying taxes on maintaining our current pool that was not suitable for us.   I also think community center in connection with the pool and shower facilities is key for our local homeless families or families with difficult living conditions. So many families made trips to PA to shower and bath their kids and to simply warm up in the cold winter months. Sauna, hot tub, showers are all essential in this bone chilling climate for families that are living in busses etc."
uKB67LoD,Thank you for offering the survey. I really hope we can generate support for this new facility.
LFCivGhX,The new Black Point pools coming to Brinnon radically alter the situation. Moving too quickly for a mid-county pool could result in both ventures failing. It would be wise to pause this planning to first see what the Brinnon pools actually provide and how they are utilized.
H6C4J87l,"It is very, very important to have a new pool and YMCA type facility for Jefferson County. I think that a weightlifting/cardio facility will be bad for other gym businesses, but everything else that our youth could use, at a reasonable cost, might get their faces out of their phones & keep busy!!"
hhfrvjQV,Not sure it is fair to tax all residents for this facility
PrDTFBhs,"I think sales tax funding discriminates against the less affluent in our community.  Those people struggle to afford food and housing and are typically working multiple jobs and long hours to make ends meet. Why should they pay a much higher percentage of their income for a pool they likely won’t be able to enjoy?  Why should they and others who live much too far away to enjoy the pool subsidize a facility for rich Port Townsend area retirees like ourselves?  I think sales tax funding flies in the face of the community good you propose to be doing.  Private funding, RE taxes, wealth tax, etc are all less regressive.  I will advocate against this project if county wide sales tax is the funding mechanism."
rvC40Soh,"Port Angeles and Bainbridge have incredible facilities. We go there. I our cherish our senior population in this town but what I don’t get is how there are very wealthy seniors moving to the area away from where they raised their kids and are a large part of our population in this county. It doesn’t make sense that they have the money to do this , but the relative minority - kids and young families , are out voted by them. Because kids annd young families anre struggling to afford properties here.  Our kids need facilities and ways to experience recreation and exercise in a safe environment.  Arguably this pool would add significant community property value to the Port Hadlock area.   If you build it we will all come.  I personally know of very wealthy people in this community who are adamant against this pool . Do they not like young families , or are they just obstructed by greed? Clearly many seniors would benefit from this as well ."
M4CKDHIe,"If you want this thing so badly, finance, build and keep it running with private money.  Black Point intends to build not one but two pools with private money.  Don't ask the public to subsidize you."
XyEB3JWz,Thanks for the efforts of the Aquatic Coalition's efforts to get a new facility in this area.  Keeping fingers crossed the old pool will last until something new will be available.  We need a pool!!!
RBC4O274,"Don't try to stick residents with this financial black hole. It didn't work in Sequim, it won't work here. Let the private sector build it and sell memberships. I bet if people had to pay the full price for what there trying to get their neigbors to subsidize, they'd have zero interest in an Aquatic Center."
nwCiDLMp,Do your job. Fix the roads. Stop spending money on your dreams we cannot afford!
7EC4Eb6q,"We have supported the idea of a public aquatic center since the beginning. We think that it will be important to the overall health of our community and important as a place to gather and socialize, young and old."
cTDTrnJq,I would likely use if for lap swim only.  I would prefer to see a Petanque court in addition an yet another Pickleball court. Petanque is low impact and can be played into your 90s. It is more social than Pickleball and is very accessible.
SvftOmel,Huge disappointment that a half million paid a new city staff person over 3-4 yrs to explore PT pool to no avail. Good effort but wasted dollars.
5tCK2GsT,"All ages. Zero entrance pool for infants. Lap lane times for seniors. Papa, Nana and me times for grandkids."
a9C4EXrs,"This is an economically depressed county. We do not have time or the funds to use, or pay for this facility. We also do not believe the tax and use costs that are being provided to us. Many residents believe the actual tax and use costs along with the maintenance / operating costs are grossly understated. Spending a small fraction of the proposed aquatic center dollars updating the current pool makes much more sense. Jefferson County and the City of Port Townsend have squandered tax payers dollars on numerous hair brained projects s"
cgkiDJGt,"at our age we just like to stay home, we wouldn't use the facility if it's built and we shouldn't be taxed for it as well !"
fTkpIYmb,Stop spending money and raising taxes!
hbB6S8OM,"I answered this as the 70+ year old that I am now. However I have been swimming in this pool for 45+ years. Using the pool was an important part of my daughter’s life when she grew up here. Swim lessons, both thru school gym at GrantSt school and private lessons, free play in the pool, party rental were all utilized for 15 years. I have also supported Salish school swim classes for students in the pool. Swimming and water safety is important to know in this coastal town.     I do have hesitations about the construction techniques I have heard recommended for a new, more affordable pool. I have used the Hood River OR town pool with its sliding roof and special plastic roofing. It is a less than optimal experience.  It can be cold and and windy, it can be steamy and humid. Local lap and exercise swimmers there often find themselves preferring to drive 40 to 60 minutes to other pools along the Gorge. Check it out."
nmCi8cZg,I would like everyone to stop taking my money for things we do not need. Let’s look at JC budget and see where we can make cuts as DOGE is doing in Washington.
3CDTA2TU,"No, thank you. I wouldn't use the pool, but it might make sense for those who want the pool to pay for it and not a county-wide tax."
07B663t1,I would prefer a facility run by the YMCA
gUfpdGrz,We believe that swimming in a chlorinated pool is too toxic for use.
eqf3cyYY,"NEVER would use a facility like this to give Port Townsend/Hadlock some entertainment while the remainder of the county just gets more taxes & less services, such as road maintenance, rules that do not apply to rural settings.  The people pushing this are all from out of Washington and have brought their life styles to an area that can't even support meager facilities that must be purchased from another county (electricity).  Now how about Forks Washington?  They seldom can get  a Sheriff to show up.  Disgusting!!!- and you want a swimming pool ?  J. Stone"
nvCKckMc,"Very important that there is a pool for JeffCo residents - especially for kids to learn to swim! We are surrounded on 3 sides with water, and all the opportunities that water provides. Kids need to learn to swim for their own safety, and so they can reasonably enjoy the activities available. Water sports are a wonderful life long endeavor and healthy choice for so many.  The PT pool is woefully inadequate and in the corner of the county. The Port Ludlow pools I have at my disposal are also inadequate for many.  Let's encourage all the water sports."
YHfxiHdT,Good thing for all the schools in the area!
hGCYTMm5,Why is it always so important for the government to keep spending money. Please learn to live within your means just like I have to. My taxes are so expensive as it is.
oCEBRLg7,I swim and kayak on Hood Canal so I do not need a pool.
dPC4SrtE,I think it is a ridiculous amount of taxpayers money you are trying to rob us of. The county is too large and would only be used by a small portion of the county. Port Townsend and Port Hadlock needs to fund if this is built.
tNCKqOv4,A saline pool would be amazing. Thank you for doing this research. I believe this will help people get out of the house when the weather is not great and build community during the sad time of the year.
BUC4T6Ta,I am not in favor of a chlorinated pool. The chemical contact is undesirable.
FzCKfbBh,Adamantly opposed.  This project should have died long ago.
sNCKziaB,"Even though my household would not make much use, I believe it's an important community asset and support the pool."
F9C440bj,"I am not interested in using or supporting this project.I have been informed that the data   collection process is rigged.  You need to start over with asimple question to the voters, Will they support a pool.If the answer is affirmative, then start addressing features."
a6CigSio,The proposed facility is beyond the means of a population this small. Aquatic centers are very expensive to maintain. Too much carbon generated having a center that everyone would have to drive to.
KUDTGwyf,I will vote NO on any property tax increase!
rtk8lx9K,"Given the current economic climate and uncertainty in WA and US, I think the extra tax could be a hardship for many. There are other areas in greater need such as public school basics. Or housing for low and middle income. With Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security under threat, senior and veteran assistance is/will be needed. Adding taxes to pay for an amenity that isn’t a life necessity is hard for me to justify at this time."
gjCi3cgL,"I’m a democrat and pool supporter, just not in the corner of the county (Port Townsend)"
jwCKnOiN,"Have private changing spaces for women. No more of the b.s. that erupted over a startled grandmother coming to the defense of young girls. If you push the transgender agenda with this, it will be to the projects demise and failure."
Y0f7UFhB,For those of us in South County this is a waste of our money. The possibility we would ever use in Pr Townsend or Hadlock are slim to never
HFCiRJkg,I simply can’t afford another tax/bond/fee. I am being spent out of my home.
IZEB4f30,More likely to use regularly in town [Townsend] vs. Hadlock. Better/ more regular bus service. Outdoor areas/ nature
yHCivIpK,Excited about this!
wnCY2eBL,We need a pool at will serve our community. It needs to be a standard competition length. Having a masters team would be super awesome!
4KDTzF1R,A new facility would open up opportunities for a greater number of people to participate in aquatics and other activities in a more central facility. It would allow me to be able to swim again and participate in aquatic exercise without driving a great distance.
ttCKNwdB,We would definitely use a facility that included a weight room/health club and would be happy to pay a membership fee for it.
qeDTgPsc,"Make the facility  a full exercise facility with machines, weights, running/jogging track and have instructors and trainers available for those who wish to pay for their services."
AWC4HHQf,This county has too many other priorities and  can't afford a pool.  We keep getting nickel and dimed till all of our taxes combined are higher than most of our living expenses combined.
S7CKMNey,exciting possibility!
keCifVBu,"At this time we would be better off spending this money fixing are infrastructure, meaning roads,parks etc."
KqCKifY7,"I think it is very important for the youth to have access to swim lessons and a pool. I don't think it needs to be a fancy facility. Focus on creating a space for swimming. Saunas and hot tubs and things like that are not essential and by not building extras will keep the cost down, and can keep taxes from rising too much. The tax burden in this county in the past few years has become unbearable for Many people. Please do not create a luxury facility that many people won't use but will have to pay for years. Just build a good pool for youth and others who just want to exercise in the water."
M9CiBu1G,"It’s a lovely idea.  However, myself and the majority of my friends cannot afford tax increases.  The current economy makes everything unaffordable"
lmEBQPrY,Are you serious!!! How many times are you running this at the taxpayer! Fix what’s broken in Port Townsend! Leave us out of this incredible money pit!!!
h0fyjJDB,"Once again, the south and east end of the county is being neglected.  We contribute the most property tax money to the county and get nothing in return.  This aquatic center should be privately funded like, getting the YMCA to build and run it."
X8EBety4,"All building, operating and maintenance costs should be paid by the actual users.   Non users should not have to pay anything . I am tired of being forced to pay for someone esle."
Z6CYE8gQ,I do not want to support any facility that is of no interest to me. It has become apparent that the data collection process allows for multiple household entries.  This must be corrected and a new survey needs to be initiated.
6qkwCk7W,Maybe we could fix our water and sewer lines first?
4FB6jasH,"I like the location,but do not want more taxes,we are being taxed to death in this county. I am for a go fund me program to raise money for the center."
bxCYj7hM,I think a new pool in the county is a terrific idea. Thanks for this opportunity to give my opinions.
ekC4ypVL,"I'm retired and on Medicare barely able to keep my house and buy food.  Pool not necessary for daily life.  Port Townsend has become very expensive to live here and I have seen taxes raised since 1979.  We need better roads!!!!!!!  Better water and drainage.  Pool only services a few!!  Let YMCA or grants or people swimming to pay for it.  I want to keep my house, if taxes continue to fund non necessary things I will have to move. I've lived here since 79'."
T1Ci8WYm,"I personally do not need the aquatic center, Kala Point has a pool.  However, it would be great for the young people.  They have so few recreactional activities in this county, so yes I support it because of that."
iiC4K08G,We don't want more taxation. Especially for a facility that serves only a small number of Jefferson County residents
qmCi1oJo,Don't build it! Don't tax me for this BS!
deCiEzzg,"I am against being taxed for something the majority of Jefferson County residents will never use. It should be pay as you go, if that won't support the pool it shouldn't be built."
48EB4h62,"I have served as the HS girls diving coach, and we have to travel to Port Angeles to access a pool with a diving well. It’s so fun to have a dive team! Please consider a diving well and I will continue to coach this sport. It is exciting for our kids to have access to something like this.   In my opinion, the Port Angeles pool has it just right. Please consider their exact design."
VPfw4c4r,I would ONLY  be able to use the whole facility if it were free to low income people. Or at least have a drastically reduced fee for usage. I would use the outdoor unheated splash if ESA dogs are allowed-this is a dealbreaker for me.
zlkUYfOr,"Yes!   1. Sliding scale or supportive programs for lower income families would be HUGE.   Part of the reason we don’t frequent the PT pool is distance from home and the cost.   Shore aquatic center has an absolutely BRILLIANT setup with an indoor splash zone and lazy river. My kids are so in love with it.   If a closer, similar venue with similar cost could happen, I would definitely bring them to swim more.   Swim lessons too, please!!! I’m begging as a mama with two little folks who haven’t had the opportunity for a swimming lesson. They swim in life jackets currently.  I’m so looking forward to having a community center offering fitness and aquatic exercise, sports, leisure and recreation.  Birthday swim parties like @ Shore in PA would be so super cool, and my family would be absolutely into that."
QhfC1bhu,Hope this becomes a Reality for the Whole of Jefferson Country!
hBfmUpvb,No
ayCKrTgL,There is zero need for public funds to be spent on this. Find private donors!! You failed in town… what does that tell you?
3XfGKmpA,I like swimming in the salt water.  Would be nice to have a public beach in the summer with a lifeguard
q7Cip64q,Let’s build this!
djEBumRk,"Though my wife and I probably would not use the facility beyond lap swimming, we recognize the value of an aquatics program in Port Hadlock."
Q2C4p1Qq,"A sauna, especially a wet sauna, is very important to me and my husband. We are would also use a heated pool and gym equipment, and would participate in classes of all types."
jhCKWkEI,I and many others would only be interested in using aquatic facilities if they are not chlorinated
kCDTukgq,I feel this would service only a small portion of Jefferson County and we should not be taxed for it.
7Mfu82Vt,"This pool is a terrible idea, a total waste of public money. Stop trying to force the public to pay for your private playground."
L5CisiYc,"The new facility will be too far away for me or visiting family to make use of it.  I think it's great that you're working on a new facility for those who live closer to it.  At the same time, I don't want to help pay for it, I don't doubt it will do much for my community.  Maybe some people in my neighborhood would drive 45 minutes each way to use the pool, maybe not.  Thank you for your work."
DtDTclov,No pool
GsDTAo0a,"I would definitely use the pool for lap swimming, preparing for triathlons"
cVCiIoY8,Most important is that we construct a new standard length pool that meets regulations for competition.  Perhaps modular construction would allow for pool construction with amenities like a gym for community functions to be added later. Residents are not likely to vote in favor of anything they view as superfluous.
JQfwtxic,Your survey is difficult to accurately take. One would need to know the costs involved. For example if it cost $2 for a couple of hours of lap swimming I'd be more likely to use it than if it cost $20. Same goes for ever activity listed.
VLDTuYxA,"Let’s get this pool built! An Olympic size pool with an offering of indoor & outdoor multi-use facilities is a must for the County. All ages need this space to further benefit health, education, competition, socialization and healing."
EmkGdM9Z,So glad to see the new location plan! Much more equitable
18fEgYlt,"A warmer and colder pool , like the one on Bainbridge is ideal. One for lap swimmers , this is ideal."
reDTWMAH,"We can't afford it. County needs to pay off its debts, fill pot holes, reduce gov wages and focus on  getting people in housing."
UJEBDOEK,Why not use chimacum high school?
sNC4c1Sm,Stop trying to force a new Pool on the Tax payers. We are having difficulty paying grocery and rental costs. Jefferson has a community pool already used by a small % of the population.
ElEB3CuO,"I grew up in a rural area...a recreational/swim center opened about 10 miles from our family farm....I was 10 and (sports programs for girls were almost non existent) became a part of their swim program...and eventually competitive team...it added a sense of physical fitness, team spirit, and self confidence that I would not have had if not for a program like this.....yes we competed individually but also relay teams...it was a ""whole family sport""....this was a ""pre title nine"" opportunity not seen in other places...to be able to be confident in the water is an incredible goal for all our rural children!!!"
bCDTV3jt,I’m so glad to see this is being looked at!
jNCKhYnq,I think your survey is somewhat flawed.  In the first sentence you say the sales tax increase is small.  This might be small for some household but not small for others.  I think to fully inform the voter you need to provide examples of what the actual bottom line cost is for a household.  What is the average spending per household that would be subject to a new tax?  Saying the tax is small misleads the survey taker from the start.
3kEBHR2g,The amount of taxes in the county is getting way out of hand.
pUEBaaLz,Focus on infrastructure.  Skip non-essential projects.
iACYxrbn,I would support it primarily because it was so difficult to find swim lessons for my 3 children and nearby pools to take them to when they were growing up in Chimacum. I never had the opportunity to learn to swim as a child and consider it important.
zBEBWSsp,The multi-use aspect of the facility is intriguing. Maybe a small outdoor theater space for concerts and plays?  Dan Westerburg
nnB6n85n,"Firstly, IMO a public pool is a great place for young people to get exercise and learn things.  Secondly I’m not at all in favor of the Brinnon Black Point development in any way shape or form."
1tCYyrL1,Nope  build it!!!!!
fpC4uJz7,the most important aspect are house of operations. I am accomplished swimmer and diver. i don’t need supervision. other pools i’ve used extended hours with no supervision. the cafe center and open area for recovery and rest would be appreciated.
3EC40E7I,I would not drive from PT to PH to the pool but I think that is a good location to accommodate the entire county.
5KC4c729,I think it makes sense to have a pool in this central area where it is more accessible to county residents.  Also it would be great for school age children and senior adults for physical activity.
ZvDT49aQ,"Yes, your survey did not allow a user to choose pool use of 1 visit per month average use."
atDT0MWo,I would be interested in an indoor walking track as part of design
uoDT29tl,"Location would be too far from my Port Townsend location for me to use, especially as traffic congestion leads to longer travel time between PT and the proposed pool site. Traffic is already beginning to slow at times. Traffic congestion is not linear. Travel times between PT and Chimicum will quite rapidly increase as traffic volume crosses threshold. Are those concerned with new pool construction considering this factor in future pool use? Seems basic for a pool study. Traffic congestion may not be a concern that the public is aware of until it suddenly happens, though it can be quite straightforwardly anticipated. Traffic forecasts for Highway 19 haven't been done, perhaps because of its low priority compared with the Seattle metro area? Or because it's evident that there would be no budget for adding lanes to the highway, nothing can be done, so why study it? The issue seems to be unacknowledged now in East Jefferson County, so is invisible, though with likely significant future consequences."
wWCYiytm,This has been such a lengthy and difficult process and needed so badly for all here! Let's do it.
FoDTGHEx,A new pool is important to be able to sustain and attract younger families. I will personally use it for Lao swimming but fully support the concept of it being a place for families/kids in our community.
h0C4Grev,"I went to water aerobics at Mountain View 2-3 times a week before the pandemic. I have not returned for various reasons, but I really miss the pool. Please, can there be more effort to refurbish the old pool and building and locker rooms rather than building a Taj Mahal to replace it? Because this state does not have an income tax and because a sales tax is  regressive, so much revenue seems to fall to property owners, and we are getting really uncomfortable about how our property taxes keep rising. I really would like a better pool option, but I am very concerned about spending getting out of control. Many other residents share my concern. Thanks for offering a survey and chance to weigh in."
c5C4USXe,Our community really needs this. Thank you
B9DTBLVx,"Can the present pool be enhanced? Add on to the present pool., make an outdoor pool with canopy… Really really prefer a pool located in Port Townsend., it’s a Long drive to Port Hadlock."
aPkmJoEx,This new facility will serve all members of our community and bring us together in an unprecedented way. All for it!!
lvC4xg1o,open swim time for joint therapy    the sooner the better
isCKQPtn,"Move the location to Port Townsend where 10,000 people live so you reduce transportation needs , mileage, and transit costs."
BJB6xCL7,"I take the bus so I am for expansion of travel times on a few bus lines, along with the idea of shuttles in the morning from Port Townsend."
PICKkkYA,"Please get it done. I’m so tired of driving to Sequim to access a decent facility.  Also there is very little to offer for children to do when visiting this area during inclement weather, which makes for a long winter when grandkids come.   I very much encourage a new facility to be a YMCA facility. One can be a member and access any YMCA facilities."
XWEBSSYC,I've always thought mid county location best!
qhCYC8hP,"Thanks for all your hard work. With kindness, Steve and Christine"
XSCYLHku,"We would probably rarely make use of it, partially location and possibly laziness, but we recognize the need for a community aquatic center, especially for youth."
3gCi5yHv,"Wow, let's get to work building it."
i9EB1kzZ,None
atB6EsGx,It will be an incredible boon to the health of our population. It will allow many a cleaner more dignified life style.
CGCKKl5E,"The proposed facility is too big, extravagant and expensive."
pDklr9wb,As with other projects the outrageous cost projections turned a lot of people off the project altogether. It would be nice to have ability for handicapped people to have access to water exercise with a lift. Perhaps Medicare would pay for this component to make it affordable for seniors and disabled.
sbDT62T3,1- county wide taxing blatantly unfair due to the size and shape of our county and the lack of access m any people would have. 2- Simple 5 or 6 lane 25 yard pool would be sufficient. All the other activities can be found elsewhere in the community.
7FCY0HpM,thank you
idCYM50q,"A single pool cannot meet the needs of all participants. A dedicated lap/competition pool kept at appropriate temperature must be separate from a wellness/recreation pool. Shore in PA is the gold standard (I have swum in 100's of pools), well worth emulating. I have only swum at Mtn View once- it is awful. Alternatively, has anyone considered having two separate facilities, including the possibility of turning Mountain View into a wellness pool and utilizing the existing structure (with PRIVATE changing rooms)? I would gladly pay tax, solicit donations or sponsorships to have a bona fide lap/competition pool under 80 degrees F!"
v5Ci0zKT,A weight and exercise room would be nice for those of us needing upper body strength.
cECKMhwk,This sounds like a great thing for the community! Especially interested in the recreation aspect of the facility.
M1CY0bUe,To many taxes already
o1B6pksh,"Available parking? Facility could attract a large number of cars. Would parking be shared with school, library?"
EnB6mrk0,"I would be very happy if the new aquatic facility was built  following all applicable building codes, was designed with common-sense longevity as a guiding vision - no reason a new facility shouldn’t give us 75-100 yrs of satisfactory performance - and wound up rather spartan. A simple building with a pool, gendered bathrooms, changing facilities and showers, spa and sauna, adequate parking, very close proximity to frequent transportation, and that’s it. No need for a Taj Mahal- type over-the-top facility which costs a lot to build and even more to maintain. This may seem like a retro-grouch request, but we humans are pretty darn adaptable and we really don’t need luxury / extravagance ( I know I know - subjective terms hard to define until we see it) when simple  supportive competence will suffice. I’ll verbally and financially support a new aquatic center if it’s a simple, competent low-maintenance built, with sturdy long-lasting materials. Ain’t rocket science- just think 1950’s design meets 2025 materials. Something like that. Good luck!"
KfC4ljFA,Is 50 meter pool would put this area on the map for year around events!
0LC4ekYG,"I'd like to see separate shallow, warmer kids pool, separate lap pool with an end devoted to aqua aerobics classes which could convert to laps or water walking or entire pool for team meets."
xGf0JXQb,this more central location makes it more desirable.
zkEBOWo6,I use the PT pool every day that it is open.
z0EBKxN7,I am excited to be able to swim again!
MICKr2jo,Fix the roads - upgrade class room educational standards - try to keep the cost of living here down - We are facing serious recession and need to be realistic.  A pool won’t help bring families here - but affordable homes might.
waB6bBs7,"We would support MOB (man overboard rescue) training, specialized CPR training for water-related accidents (esp. drowning), underwater repair (hulls, docks, etc.) training, scuba training"
lXk7aDd4,"I realize that funding is a necessary thing for this pool, and I still  support a new pool even if all the funds raised are short of  for this project.  I pay for a lot of things through taxes that I don’t use, but this pool is very important to me for staying healthy and for exercising.  At my age, 77 years old, it’s the only really good exercise I can do, but no pool would make me either travel a lot OR be totally inactive.  Inactive is not a good choice and traveling to other pools is costly, and unlikely to happen in bad winter weather.  The other thing to consider, is when I travel to other pools, I will be shopping out of county for goods and services while  on a trip to a pool.  Me and my friends have done this when our pool has been closed, thus we are spending money out of our county!  To have a well rounded community that offers something for everyone, a pool must be in the offering."
eOC4UAy7,Build it and I will come. Good luck.
joCiy9Qr,"The existing pool does not serve families, only senior citizens. Other than aftercare and over the summer, there is no family, teen, or young children presence on the entire Mountain View facility.  This is utterly criminal.  This location can be maintained as as is, but the new location has to actually serve the families of the county.  Maybe we could have a separate lap pool on the grounds that is open all day.  What about a slide, or lazy river?  Families in Port Townsend over the last 20 years have to drive to Bainbridge to have fun with their kids in a proper aquatic center."
jhEBWxDr,A new swimming place to spend time as a family and engage with others in the community would be a game changer!
wACKP7ic,We go not often because available pools are so far away
yIB6tPrv,There are way better uses of our tax money for healthy reacreational purposes. A pool is a money hog for future budgets. Focus on more trails and trails that connect us to the Olympic Discovery Trail.
iZCibEiM,"We really need anything geared towards or at least, kid friendly,  in this community! This community is centered around the baby boomer generation and is not very inclusive or tolerant of children. We need safe and healthy places for our teens and young people. We need more places snd activities for families. Our kids need swim lessons!"
BgCi2ePj,"We just need a good swimming pool large enough for youth competitions, but not other rooms for non-aquatic activities. Venues for non-aquatic activities are already provided in the city and county."
UYC454Km,jefferson co goverment shows continued support for biological men in women's showers-and will be sued again soon. waste the tax payers money in a better way
oqC4oo0h,"Brinnon residents will have access to an aquatic facility when the resort is completed that will include a lap pool and a kids pool.  There will be other recreational facilities there as well.  Therefore there is no reason for us to fund another facility in the county.  Moreover, county residents will be able to come to Brinnon to use our facilities."
pZkkxXpR,Please scale your ambitions to the community. Make the most of the existing facilities and resist the urge to take on exciting but ultimately too expensive for our community projects.
0dC4kWM3,This county consistently over promises and under delivers.  It is not prudent to start another failure.  Lets suceed with what we have first.
w8CilIqk,"Consider an outdoor picnic area with tables and spiffy playground equipment.  With a trail that contains regular 8-10 stop areas for activities like stretches, maybe a stop for a pull-up bar area, a 5 step up and down area, etc."
ZEC4Fg8q,Please consider the cost  what we need is a 4-6 lane lap pool of official length and either a separate or combined shallower pool   for children and water aerobics ( at the Tukwila pool the two are separated by a wall waist high)  What helped defeat the last try was adding all the other features that someone might wish for( dream big ) extras cost money to build and maintain
hICKReOd,"When you asked how often would we use the facility in the last section to ask that question, the choices were somewhere unreasonable, meaning they seemed designed to elicit a particular response. The choice ""once or twice a month"" would have been a reasonable choice and and that would have been our answer."
snCKLCNd,"I thinks its great, keep going and make this happen yesterday - ha! Growth of a community is essential and we need more places to connect with each other. This can galvanize our county, bringing people together. We need to invest in the future and give kids of all ages a safe place to play and learn."
IpCKyRm6,"Thank you for placing the center in a place that all can go to, rather than in PT. I will use the facility for swimming and other athletic activities."
GkCibAOP,"This is unfortunate for those that live in the southern part of Jefferson County. There is already a pool for Port Townsend, so why would it be fair to build another so close?  Secondly, why in this green earth would you want a hot or a sauna to maintain in an area that is so high in drug addicts. That is the start of a cesspool of disease!  Last, but not least, if this would be utilized by the school districts, let it come out of their budgets!  Seriously, residents of Jefferson county have been slammed by rising property taxes and will not support anymore!"
XlCK2b25,Great idea! A good central location and fabulous for all ages.
QpfSlYQw,"As a Maritime community, we would be irresponsible not to teach our residents how to swim and offer them programs and opportunities to remain active year round."
uSEBqjIa,This is not needed.  Don’t trust the county to manage this.
yQB68iam,"No more taxes!  If this is truly desired by the community, build this facility from private donations and run as a for profit business or non-profit organization."
8yB6aRAc,Fund the facility with membership fees paid by users.
PyB6tMvQ,We need to fix the pool we already have instead of introducing new taxes
bmEBAGzG,"I dont believe a new facility is necessary.  If the small majority of people want it, they can support it."
VZC4KOav,I do not think county can afford this new aquatic facility
y6C40Vfd,"Although I am 75-years old and no young children, I would welcome an exercise pool program, physical therapy, and gym that offers exercise for older residents. I am beyond thrilled the new pool will be centrally located as I have no interest in driving 30-minutes one way to Pt Townsend. The proposed pool will be highly utilized by more Jefferson country residents who would finally have access to healthy recreation. Thank you for choosing Pt Hadlock location."
F8f75cVy,Do something in Brinnon for  change
4cB6flWq,"I am not opposed to an aquatic center, however, I believe it is fiscally not prudent with the need for infrastructure improvements and we are running on a deficit now.  This is how cities go bankrupt.  With Trump in office, we are all at risk financially. An aquatic center is not high on my priority list at this time."
SifrouW0,Would Jefferson transit be involved with routes from Port Townsend to the pool facility?
Fzf3rjBU,I really hope the new Jefferson County aquatic center gets the green light. It’s so important for our community.
5ykQiRe7,"Huge fan.  Oldest child grew up in Portland, OR with heated pools everywhere.  She's an avid swimmer who boycotts Mountain View bc she says its too cold and hours are erratic.  Tried twice to do swim lessons with youngest child, but the teachers were inconsistent, the time and lesson structure insufficient."
syB6fMgI,I would need to make sure there were private changing areas if I were to use a pool in Jefferson County again.
SokHnh5h,Great idea to build in Hadlock
8hfzeLsH,My only comment is that there has to be more swim lanes for laps than that small pool in mountain view.  Also prefer steam room to sauna
QPCKnOWm,"Please do not tax, tax, tax to have such a facility. Although this is something we need; find ways to support it without taxing the citizens out of needed living expenses."
l5CYmkZF,"My daughter and her family will soon return to live in Port Townsend. I am pretty sure she will connect her family *young kids"" with the new pool opportunities.  Feeling comfortable with swimming in the waters of Puget Sound is important to me.The community pool will help many individuals, learn how to swim safely and confidently and feel ready to explore the Aquatic waters of Puget Sound which is all around us. Having a safe place to support a beginning swimmer, regardless of their age, is important  and the pool is a good place to get started.         The Port Townsend Pool has been a delightful place for me to connect with friends and families while we played as our kids were growing up in Jefferson County.  Thank you for your support of public facilities in our communities."
NpB6n54P,"As a competitive swimmer I think the most important aspect of the pool is that it actually be a regulation size (25 yds or 50 m) with open lanes for swimming available most times of day. Additionally, having a non-chlorine pool would be great."
u2B6ylff,"We need a swimming pool that is warm and accessible for young children. My child lives next to the water, and still cannot swim (at 5 years old) because we have to drive to Sequim or PA to access the warmer, shallow pools. I am so hopeful this facility will be build in port hadlock!"
RzfPSmFc,"Rebuild the swimming pool in the current area.  I believe ""users"" would be greater in PT (where people could complete errands & possibly various  appointments)."
8bEBW4g0,Great proposed location - improved access for County residents
T6CKtLlU,Used the Port Townsend pool a lot when my kids were little -starting at about 6 months old with baby classes. Later with pool parties. I would be much more likely to use pool closer than going into Port Townsend.
EmkPE6dj,There are too many other priorities in this county and this is a luxury this county cannot afford.  Our taxes are already so high and the state and county keeps adding to them.
EXfQoEJn,"If the “new” aquatic center was olympic size, it could draw in revenue from organized state swim meets on the peninsula— filling hotels and increasing restaurant use.   I am all in favor of a new facility that can promote and handle adult fitness swimming.  Swimming keeps me walking and decreases my chronic pain!"
jHCYs6P1,Stop any further efforts. Redirect funds to afforable housing.
NjC4BYMd,It would be nice to have a pool in the area
75CKjiV8,This pool is a terrible idea.  We can barely pay our taxes now.  If you want a pool sell member ships and let it pay for its self.  I am tired of being ripped off.
xrC4IsJP,A good aquatics center enhances the quality of life of the community.
8JCYZz1Q,"We simply cannot afford a $60,000,000 aquatic center. Replace the pool to school meet specs, and let it go at that."
g3EBQaMo,"It sounds like you're after a community center, vice, a swimming pool.  I would support a pool in port hadlock, but not a community center that happens to have a pool.  The proposed $36 million plus facility in port. Townsend, it's too extensive, and now that you want to move it to port hadlock, you need to cut this cost in half to make the voters not choke on the cost.  The construction of the pool needs to be with local contractors and not out of county or out of state people."
0nCKnoV0,Love the idea and the central location! Living near water seems like it would be ideal to have swimming be a key component for the community and safety with swim lessons in a modernized facility.
bWfuoOJa,No on this aquatic facility
2aC4HqbG,Waste of money
OCCYYBCe,Do not do it. Taxes have increased way  too much already. Do not increase than one with Penny!!!!!
WaDTfzIU,"WE have no interest in paying for your project. Nothing. Zero. You need to stop trying to pick the pockets of taxpayers. If you want a pool, YOU need to pay for it."
upC4Gnsj,i would be more for indoor tennis courts than i would pickleball courts. and would prefer a saltwater pool to a heavily chlorinated one. same for hot tub.
ZREBuLoW,Build it and we will come!
4dkRliBg,Cape George has it own swimming pool So I don’t want to be taxed for another pool!!!!!!
2wCKwXDV,No more taxes.  I do not support this
V8DTDhgW,It would add new taxes. We are on a fixed income. Our property taxes have gone up every year and things are getting tighter.  We vote NO!!!
L0CKLLrB,Thanks for considering a more central location. Those of us in South County appreciate it!
hxEBCI4Q,Prioritize the needs of the county! A pool is not in the top 10.
kVCY6CsX,"Stick to the most widely used programming: lap swim, youth swim teams, and the fastest growing sport is pickleball.  Would love an outdoor facility vs. indoor but I get that's probably not popular. Thanks!!!"
SKB6Xx5T,Please find funding that does not require a tax increase.
HiEBVcBD,"Until I can be officially assured the YMCA will not have any involvement in operations and control, I will not support this proposed facility."
oPB6nvd9,Not needed.  Road work and repairs are much more important.
STEBag2h,No more taxes! We’re done with it. Learn to live within your means and budget accordingly as the rest of us do
TqB6UVFr,"1. I would be supportive if the facility includes  weight/resistance and aerobic equipment.  2. There is no mention on if there will be usage fees as well as the sale tax support.  If there is sales tax support, then I think usage should be free to residence for basic usage such as pool and fitness ."
knkPVI4H,"Jefferson has many needs, this is not one of them..   Roads would be a better place as things the county needs..."
qmDTmmac,Ridiculously expensive!  Fix the existing pool and get rid of the Woke YMCA!
aGDTWy61,"There are much more important projects needing public money, eg. roads and road  repair, fully staffing the Marrowstone fire station and improving access to health care services."
4YC4mbRn,"We already pay to support 2 pools in our HOA.  I don't need to pay for another pool.  Our taxes are already too much!  Instead of raising taxes for another pool, how about trimming the county budget to find the money or rehabilitate the existing pool."
x7C43CJU,Absolutely a waste of tax payer funds and NOT needed.  Fix the darn roads.  Make housing affordable stop paying the bureaucrats who run the city exorbitant salaries
2jEB2P4B,"A public pool with some or all the features described would be wonderful, yet there’s insufficient funding at local level to build and support it. There certainly will be no more state or federal funding sources for foreseeable future. What is available are three private homeowner pool with recreational features (Kala Point, Port Ludlow North Bay and South Bay) already in the county, perhaps any of these homeowner groups would be open to lease of their wonderful facilities for some part of each day or week to be open to the public, paid for with public funds."
lJDTJPtj,When you can't properly fund essentials you shouldn't be looking for more ways to spend on non-essentials.
1rEBDeE0,No tax payer money should be used untill every road is fixed and all infrastructure i.s updated
9qfhJZ7M,Thanks!  Good luck!
9jB6C3ao,NO NEW TAX!! NO PFD!!
fvEBxHMZ,"We don’t need more taxes.  Port Ludlow, Kala Point and Cape George all have their own swimming pools.  We don’t need another one.  In addition, my family will not use a swimming facility that allows men in women’s showers or dressing rooms!  I vote NO on an aquatic center in Chimacum.  They decided to offer the aquatic center in the Chimacum area because the County knew we didn’t support paying more taxes for a pool for Port Townsend."
0gDTl8AC,I am an old broad so the family questions don’t pertain to me but I really feel we need a pool for us seniors and just as importantly we need it for the children!  Hope you can make this happen 
7pCKDtTw,"Consider the very high cost of maintenance, which nobody seems to be looking at."
9Ck4Rf4f,I am excited about the new pool.
1xCY9Lxn,as always jefferson county  is very corrupt and this would be no exception
WzDTZ6fq,"I believe we need an Olympic size pool for swim team/clubs and a place for swim lessons.  Those that want to use the pool for fitness/therapy is also a good idea.  Beyond that, all the other glitz and glam is unnecessary. Wasted tax dollars.  And, it should not be run by the YMCA!"
9vCix1pl,"Free swim lessons for kids. Important to learn how in this area with so many beaches, so much kayaking, boating, etc. Make available to schools who can bus kids in for classes. This is why I am willing to be taxed for it - not for all the fluffy stuff being considered part of it."
3wCYdYkW,I have no intentions of supporting this facility
a0EBPvkR,"I hope that our community can reach  consensus about the need for an aquatic center. Currently, my grandchild is taking swimming lessons at the Mountain View Pool. I watched our two daughters taking lessons from some of the same instructors that are now teaching him to swim. That indicates the dedication of our local experts. Imagine what they could do with a better, more reliable facility. The need for swimming lessons, aquatic exercise classes, water therapy, swim team, synchronized swimming, etc. is so great. My concern isn't so much about building a new aquatic center. It is how to keep it staffed with well paid instructors and life guards. I have had many classes cancelled over the years. The Mountain View facility has issues that lead to cancellations, but lack of staffing is the other reason. Please factor staffing and good wages into your planning process."
03k27EIt,The pool in Port Townsend has been woefully mismanaged favoring ridiculous transgender accommodation.  I have little confidence that a new aquatic center would not make the same mistake  public good
irfBbQlk,I’ve never known another city and county with such poor prioritization. We have actual problems to solve here. We’re not to the “let’s add luxuries” stage. How about we add necessities first.
BHB6SJ9m,The Port Angels model of a private construction and operation should be done here.
6kC4Jjqw,We hope that the disastrous event in the Port Townsend YMCA/YWCA changing room will never happen again!
w5CY6QS6,"In Ketchikan I use the rec center attached to the aquatic center several times a month for walking the track, yoga & weight training"
9pEBiDvM,Keep your pool in Port Townsend and fix it up
1qB6QDQ5,"I feel this is SO vital to our community and could really be a special place for all to use!  As someone who is raising kids in this community and here to stay, I really value and look forward to this resource for my kids future youth years, as well as my own health, fitness and community interactions!"
yMkb5H5N,I think it is a fantastic idea. It would be great if we can make sure it has enhancements for safety for the elderly in particular.
vskc4VDt,"Despite my household's personal needs not including youth safety, sports, play, we believe it's critical to provide safe, clean, places for kids to explore water in their lives. I also feel, given our living here surrounded by open water, everyone should have water safety training from a young age."
YAfSNwkv,"A really nice fitness gym with modern state of the art machines, I would like to go to at least once a week. The proximity to my home makes a big difference"
m5kBnEFT,NO NEW TAXES!!!!! Your fancy port townsend pool should be paid for by PT. The economy is about to take a nose dive and people can’t afford this. Get your pool built by the rich people in PT.
rifwKZLD,Community spaces are so important
U1C4UGji,We need this for our kids!
ovDT9EU9,No new taxes!
DgCYmP9R,"It's hard to get by now, not going to add another expense."
TRCKrjFw,The data collection process is totally flawed in the participation is unlimited.
uYEBVvKz,"This facility would quite literally be life changing for me and my household, especially in the winter. This facility would instil health and wellness in our community and remove barriers of access. 100000% need this."
OiC4Sm0z,I want the pool. I live in the mobile home park across the street from the county library
vyCiQ5N5,"One. Design with long-term low maintenance cost. Incorporate, solar, electric panels, ground source heat pump, variable deficient flow distribution. BAS system with occupancy sensors 2. Optimize water, conservation design, including: rainwater catchment used in toilets and landscaping, recirculating treated water with optimal, filtration required, low maintenance, and filtration of waste water pipe to new sewer system. 2. Incorporate human centric, LED lighting design for optimal, health, benefits, and creative light coloring for entertainment and stimulus, especially for events. 3. Review other communities in Washington and beyond for innovations in funding. May need to collect Kate with another type of community benefit. I.e.: Port Angeles early childhood development center next to their pool."
gTB6p9uY,I am a water walker and would like to see more effort made to have lanes dedicated to our use when classes are being held at the pool.  I'm finding it harder and harder to find a time when the shallow end isn't full of either aerobic class members or kids and their parents.  The morning single lane is short because it gets too deep and people come and go in that lane.
DgCYOCNu,Small tax! Nothing is a small tax and you’re never satisfied just keep taking more. Can’t afford to live here anymore. NO POOL
Hjk0AxA2,I feel that there are a few elite individuals who are pushing for a community funded feature that is not supported by the community. They are attempting an end run bypass with political support. When will this end.
lOCY9klq,This county can't afford this.  Stop raising and wasting my tax dollars
IsCK2IVl,"Since we are living in a water-centric area it seems important that we all learn to swim. I played in Lake Michigan as a child but never learned the real skill, not too late to learn."
F8fFFSjw,"I am eager for space that could host group fitness classes, such as zumba."
bJkIAdAz,The pool should be funded primarily if not exclusively by user fees.  A public pool is not a necessary public amenity.
iekbwYoW,"If you built something like the Haselwood Y in Silverdale, with weightlifting, bicycling and weight training equipment, then a pool makes sense.  A pool by itself has little yo no value and serves just a tiny sliver if the community’s needs.  Why not collaborate with the Y in order to build something?  We all know the Y in Port Townsend should be demolished."
x4B6tqZZ,Strongly Against
Zxkl85cX,"Jefferson County taxes are continuing to climb.  We don't need any more tax hikes or additional levies to pay for a recreational center when there are plenty of natural recreational resources in the area that we live in (hiking trails, beach fronts, etc.)"
xWkOj09X,"A ""Swimming pool"" is necessary,  an ""Aquatic Center"" belongs in ""The City of Dreams"" book.  Lets build what we need and can afford."
71EBhllK,"For our community, push on.   I won't enjoy the fruits of your labor but major issues from our past like a new ferry dock or Kah Tai Park demonstrates that our community can step up for the greater good."
MwkFl95D,My family would much prefer a non-chlorinated aquatic center. A saltwater pool with UV filtration (or similar system) would greatly improve our interest in regular use of the facility.
r8CiVCwo,"I am from Santa Barbara, CA where we have many public pools and water training and sports available to  people of all ages and because of that I spent a lot of my childhood swimming, exercising, and confident in all types of open water. Most kids went through Jr. Lifeguard training at an early age, I was on swim team, played water polo, surfed and did all of these things confidently. It all started with the community swim lessons for babies, I had my first swim class as a 1 year old, where the babies are trained to flip on their back. Growing up with this confident swimming foundation really sets the stage for kids to make healthy choices. I don't have kids but I would love nothing more than to have an option for the current and future generations to get that head start. We learn how to swim in pools in the PNW, I can't say I've seen a baby swim class in the ocean up here, even in the summer. Also, I would love if this facility was in line with what Scandinavian saunas and pool houses have with options for hot pools and steam and sauna rooms for daily use, I would pay for a monthly membership if this were part of the facility. Thanks!"
IiCKhmRs,Very excited for this possibility!
2kCivMWZ,"While I think the aquatic center is a good idea, I am not likely to use it often because I am active with my HOA facilities which are much closer to Hadlock."
y4C4Q1n3,I have been involved in water sports activities all my life. I believe all people should have access to these type of activities that they can continue to be active for their entire life. Indoor gym type activities are very important and especially needed in our climate… for all ages.
ozCKFdQy,"Sufficient funds should be raised through grants, donations, state and federal sources. Most of the residents locally are retired, and probably pay a fair share of taxes annually. Even a small additional tax adds to the financial burden for those who are retired. The recent Chimacum School levy is not a small amount. For the aquatic center, have an admission fee, or a membership fee to help defray operational cost. Without doubt an aquatic center in Port Hadlock would be a health benefit to the local community, but an alternative way of funding must be secured, not another tax."
FDEBDU40,Port Hadlock is a perfect central location for a recreational facility for everyone living in Jefferson County. Many young parents live in Port Hadlock  an this would help families in many ways.  I would like an indoor running track because it rains a lot in the winter.
hrCYu8ha,I am a single pregnant 32 year old woman. I counted my unborn child as the 2nd person in my household. When my baby is born I would use this facility frequently and it would benefit and support me greatly. I hope that there will be safe childcare available. I’m very excited by the prospect of the pool and the rock climbing wall. Both of which i would use frequently. The closest rock climbing gym I have found is in bainbridge. My property is walkable distance to the library.
JqfyuIK9,"We already pay for pools at The Beach Club and The Bay Club in Port Ludlow.  It is unfair and idiotic to expect Ludlow residents, many on fixed incomes, to add more to the already high cost-of-living.  We will resist by any means to prevent being taxed for something Ludlow residents won't use."
uBDTo4r8,I would like it to be in port townsend!
2yCYxBto,Pickleball facilities combined with the pool would get huge support and additional use.  Both outdoor and indoor pickleball venues are in demand and increasing.
8wCK2fN0,"I love our PT YMCA pool and have been going there for 15 years!  It’s such an important facility for my age group!  Thank you, life guards and staff!"
SfCi7f7N,Survey is too long.
BJCiUMZE,Not interested
jkCizK9H,Port Townsend is not a country club. If you must have country club amenities move to a different town.
aFkIAU1U,I am unlikely to use the new pool but I am still in full support.
8kEBi5tr,"With the population density of the area you've designated vs the planned future density of Port Townsend, I really question the number of daily users for a Port Headlock location."
6jEBrK4Y,"Let's repair/maintain the Mountain View facility, managing hopes and expectations to an attainable level."
idCiDesj,Centraly  locate in Port Hadlock and support with  county bus route.
1KEBaXmb,"I live in PT and would not drive to Hadlock to use the pool.  Our daughter walks/bikes to swim club at Mountain View 2x/week, but we would probably not drive her to a facility in Hadlock.  Hadlock is not walkable/bikeable.  I'm sure we would use the facility occasionally, but probably not regularly."
X3Cifloi,"I understand that moving an aquatic facility to a place outside of city limits would perhaps decrease the cost, but I would use such a facility less. A 40 minute drive is a consideration. Iwould be more likely to use it and be in favor of it if it was closer than Port Hadlock."
mZCY5ix0,I hope this dream comes true.
9gDT4yrH,We are not in favor of paying more taxes to support ANY aquatic center.    Any additional taxes would be better spent supporting our homeless and/or to build low cost housing for our residents.
9yCY8JBs,"Spend the extra money needed to make it useful for seniors, lap swimmers, the disabled, and school kids of all ages."
QhfBbFhP,Can you build a facility like PA that the citizens can afford? It would be great but can we afford it? Good luck
86f3I1FB,I would like to see many lanes in a large lap pool to accommodate many people at once.
DWfHXUbA,Similar concept to Shore Aquatic in PA
EmkXD1LO,"We are in desperate need of a new pool space, for kids to learn to swim and play, and adults to lap swim. As a family we have regularly taken trips to port Angeles specifically to use their amazing pool space which is so much more kid friendly for swimming."
0fB6BeNT,"We support this project whole heartedly! The sooner the facility is built and useable, the better for our family!"
a6C4qwtu,LAZY RIVER!
ORklFS4E,Swim lessons for kids would be the most important part-
eeC4mzLM,"It’s imperative that all of our school children learn to swim living as we do surrounded by water. That should be goal one.  Also, all of the “ No PT pool tax” signs have made a substantial negative impact on our efforts to promote a new pool in our community. I manned the JAC table at the PT farmers market one Saturday and that was made evident to me. There needs to be plenty of publicity regarding how minimal a tax it really is. If one woman can put up enough signs to influence so many people, surely those supporting a new pool can do better."
uCDTkhfw,Please consider working with JeffCo Transit to make public access to the pool easy at times of day most useful to families and seniors.
hjC4kMs5,A full community center with multiple lines of business may make it easier to recover costs associated with maintaining a pool.
jgB6jPIs,"Since it’s going to be a drive for most users ( no bike path option, sadly) a shuttle service would help decrease traffic on an already very busy road! "
uVCi3fTm,I fully support this pool we need it so much for our community. My family needs it for our mental and physical wellness especially in the cold months.
EWC4WjBc,Build it for the whole community. Everyone should know how to swim in our part of the country. And it is an important place to exercise for many people.  We should come together as a community and provide this  it is a worthwhile shared cost. Make the cost clearer. Not just the formula. What would be the cost per year with the levied amount in your property?? Printed need that info to be able to not have a knee jerk reaction.
rCCKgUnN,"I see way too many unhealthy, unfit adults and seniors in this community.  There is a definite need for a community center that focuses on health and fitness, movement and socialization.  The water/pool component is off-putting and unnecessary.  I would support a community center, not a pool."
