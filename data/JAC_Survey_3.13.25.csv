I don’t believe in anything state of the art or competition level- it is too much financial burden on the majority of this community. I also believe a pool is extremely beneficial to the vast older population for health purposes or for those recovering from injuries. EDUCATION is key. Please promote swimming programs in the school systems (elementary) and make it accessible for all, not just the financially privileged. In the end, I am fully comfortable swimming in our cold waters 6 months out of the year so I do not need this pool, however I do believe it is optimal for all in our community to have access to one, especially if it can be incorporated into our early education programs. If adding a gym or cafe makes it more appealing, so be it. I will support that. Thank you for this convenient opportunity to voice an opinion."

I would very likely use an outdoor pool and/or hot tub. If swimming instruction was available outside I would do that. If water exercise was available outside I would use that.  I am a nonbinary transgender man. I have been mercilessly harassed in shared changing/shower facilities all my life pre transition.  I have avoided pools most of my life due to harassment and I barely learned to swim although I love the water. I have never used single gender or shared shower/changing facilities post transition.  unless there are single stall showers and changing rooms, both with full curtains, that are expressly gender nonspecific (all sex/genders), then I would not be using the showers or changing facilities. That would greatly reduce the likelihood of me ever using the pool. On the other hand, if such facilities were available to me, and the pool itself was outdoors, I would envisage pretty frequent use.   I believe a pool is essential for our community. I would love a facility I felt comfortable using.  But I strongly believe we need one even if I were never to use it.    However I cannot support funding that uses a sales tax. This is a very regressive type of tax that puts too great a burden on people with less economic means. It takes a much higher percentage a poor person’s available funds than it does a richer person’s. It also tends to hit harder on  people who do not have the ability to go out of county to do their shopping. I believe it will also be keenly felt by anyone undertaking a major building project here.  The result will be an even greater tendency to purchase materials out of county, for example at big box building suppliers, and that will not be good for our local businesses.    I would also imagine that the sales tax would be applied to services purchased here? Would there be an added tax for dental work? For window washing and roof cleaning or repair? Again, I believe people will increasingly use out of county providers for services and this will not benefit the community.  Please find a less regressive funding mechanism.   I understand that one of the goals of the facility is for use by the public schools. And indeed the new proposed location is to be near a public school.  It seems to me that if the schools are to be using the facility then the school system should be expected to fund some part of it that is equivalent to the anticipated percent of use.  I used to live right next to a school that had a pool that was open to the public during certain hours. I used it once and then never used it. My experience was that the public hours were very short creating a massive competition for space and time. There were so many faster swimmers who were very impatient with beginners like myself.   in the afternoons the schedule was extremely crowded with school-related events, and open swimming ended up being late in the day. Too late and again too crowded.    I fear that having a pool be literally on site of a school will create these kinds of scheduling pressures. And if it is to be used much of the time or half of the time by the schools, then school funding should contribute to paying for it.  I will also weigh in to say that while I appreciate the challenges of building.a new pool on the site of the old pool, a facility in Chimacum will not provide the same level of access to the aging population inhabiting Port Townsend. My observation is that many elderly users currently walk to the pool, and a number of somewhat younger users bike to it.  t. Your survey does not ask about how people would get to the pool.  A number of us elderly folk in the area mask and rarely use public transport because other riders don’t mask. And a number of us are not really comfortable driving long distances.  Biking in this county outside of the city of PT is like handing your life over to a crazy game of a Russian roulette.  My point is that moving the pool out of the City of PT really changes/reduces access for an aging population that would greatly benefit from pool use and from the ability to walk or bike there.    I do not live in the City of PT but I would be way more likely to use a pool located there than in Chimacum: From my perspective it would be a lot better if the pool were located somewhere closer to halfway between.  However, I am under the impression that that ship has sailed And that the site has  pretty much been selected.  I don’t love it. I’ll use the pool less if at all. But I support the pool."

I've lived many different places and I've seen the positive effects a community based center like this can have on the physical, mental and social health of a city, or in this case a county. We support this effort 100%. We may not live long enough to use it but our many younger family members who live here will definitely use this facility and benefit from it. One more thing, such a facility will also will improve value in multiple ways for east Jefferson County. Thanks!"

From school-aged children in swim safety programs and swim lessons at an early age to middle and high-schoolers participating in swim clubs and teams, to seniors doing aqua fitness and water walking, our community has a responsibility to support physical and mental wellness. Further, this facility must be accessible to all, regardless of age, demographics, and socio-economics. This is not the time to build an upscale facility that mimics a private club."

As mentioned, I am new to the area from out of state and truly upset and disappointed that Jefferson County has fought the new resort development so hard in Brinnon. So do you think that Brinnon does not deserve it? One thought is...why would JFCO not want those additional tax dollars that could help Brinnon thrive and become an area similar to Port Ludlow? This town has so much potential and if that were approved, this small town might actually become a highlight to the county instead of being a thorn in JEFCOs xxxx!   I am at the point I would like to sell and I am one of the most expensive home in my neighborhood and because of all the actions recently, I would never be able to recoup the outrageous price I paid for my home. To say I regret coming here is understatement. Please consider helping this town become something, not penalize it with useless projects that will not benefit  us and give us the resort!

With Jefferson County not having anything for Children I think it would be important to design an aquatic center that makes the area more appealing to tax paying families with children. A lazy river or splash pad would bring more families and use. A square pool is going to make families continue to give money to outside counties. The short drive is not going to outweigh the amenities found other places. Instead of being cheap I would rather pay more in taxes and entry to an appealing aquatic center. There are enough private pools in the area that are squares designed for lap swimming. A diving board and lazy river appeal to all ages.

Throughout high school I was lucky enough to have my great grandma drive me to swim team practice every day after school and morning dive practice on weekends but many kids, especially those farther into west jefferson missed out on the opportunity to participate due to the distance/lack of transportation. Our current pool as loved as it is has been holding our local swimmers back in a number of ways, it's not standard length nor deep enough for diving. Because of that we couldnt hold meets at our home pool and had to commute to sequim for dive practice, thankfully the coach was willing to drive us all himself. A new aquatic facility in a more central area of Jefferson County would greatly benefit the whole community and widen the opportunity to participate in aquatic sports for more young people in our area."

I wonder how many people are out there in boats/paddleboards/kayaks etc. that don’t know how to swim - INCLUDING the school groups that the maritime center instructs!  Kids -and adults - cannot learn to swim in 50 (or less) degree water.  I suspect most of the people that are against a pool don’t know how to swim, or are uncomfortable in water. Access to a pool could change that.   It doesn’t need to be an elaborate facility - we don’t need a water park - just a well thought out pool with 6 lanes that could be used for everything from recreational swims/lessons/swim team/water aerobics…. All this can be accomplished with a well thought out schedule.  FAR more people will use a pool than a golf course,( which seems to have the most attention these days).  I’ve never seen kids on that golf course, and golf will not save your life.  The golf course is already there. Leave it alone and let’s get a pool for the masses that WILL use it!  If you build it, they will come."

I do think it should be as easily accessible to all county residents as is reasonable and this is a good location. Good hard thought and input will be needed to ensure we get a facility that is attractive without being a “Taj Mahal” pool. The regressive sales tax option is problematic but that’s a function of a large statewide systemic problem. I suspect two-tenths of a cent will be more palatable to more voters than a property tax assessment. I think another overlooked aspect of having this pool and having it where it would be is further building the connections between Port Townsend and Chimacum/Quilcene students.

The idea of community spaces, community kitchen and shower facilities is also really important for our community and exciting! I personally have so much excitement about the climbing/boulder gym idea. Bring climbing to Jefferson County!! Bouldering or ropes I would definitely use frequently and know many people who would be excited about this.

I personally don’t give two shits if the pool gets built if my kid doesn’t  get the opportunity to use it, after we the working class get off of work.

During the week. They have gyms that are open till nine in multiple rooms. They have wonderful amenities. They do farmers markets in the winter inside. They hold events for Christmas markets. You can rent out rooms for birthday parties. They offer safe Havens for people to get out of the elements and to move their bodies. It’s wonderful to see old and Young altogether in a community. I am very excited that this might possibly happen in Port Hadlock. I think this community would greatly benefit from having such a facility for families and multigenerational folks to use.

As our household has two former lifeguards, a serious swimmer and a pool loving kid, we would be very excited and supportive of a new pool. We would happily travel from PT to Port Hadlock for it. In addition my local father in law is a dedicated (daily in the summer in local lakes) swimmer and would use this pool extensively as well.   Having a good community pool is so important to our county. We live surrounded by the ocean and teaching all of our children to swim and general water safety is incredibly important for safety. Thank you!"

It seems to be based average driving distance based on anywhere in the county, rather than average commute time for each county resident.

Biking, walking, more public transportation, driving shorter distance.  Also adds less congestion to the one road in and out of town.  Your question ...would you support an aquatic center was tied to the comment that you plan to locate it in port hadlock.

She and the other parkboard members traveled to many different communities and looked at pools.  They decided after years (It took years and many times voted down by the public our family voted no until the last year.) They went the route they did because they found all the extras would attract the off visitors to come and help pay for the rest of the pool.  I am pretty sure it worked.  But we are a different area and there are already fancy pools close.  So I think if a pool is built here a know frills pool is best and remembering that many of us live here to be without the frills and gimmicks of other places.  I would rather my tax money be spent on the purchase of a swim beach park in Quilcene but can see the benefit of a pool and would probably take my littlest to swim lessons once in her life.  Who knows maybe when I am an old lady I would go swim some laps at 6am twice a week.  Thanks for listening.

I feel that applying more financial burden in a county that already has a relatively high sales tax will only make life harder for lower income residents. While I can understand the community benefit of a pool space I do not believe this these will outweigh the  negative impact on our local economy. If the pool space generates income to the county, I do not believe it will flow back toward the lower income residents who will be sacrificing more intrinsically for the space.  What is the point in adding a resource if it will put the highest burden on those who lack resources? It seems to cater to the wealthy, rather than the community.  Ultimately, my decision to vote NO against the pool tax is a lack of information that will allow me to trust that the pool space will be properly maintained, managed, utilized or any assurance that in any unforeseen case of closure that the new space will continue to be utilized.

Please do the research in a responsible way!  Is there ANY municipality (city or county) that has been able to support construction and ongoing maintenance of a pool or an aquatic facility with fewer than 35,000 residents?    As we know, grants are less and less reliable, and need to be understood as ""one time revenue"".  Continuous revenue like a sales tax paid by fewer than 16,000 households will never be sufficient to cover the perpetual cost of an aquatic facility - no matter how much in user fee income can be collected from those who say they are likely users.    Swimming and water exercise are not the only way to achieve individual rehabilitation and wellness goals, although they are arguably THE MOST EXPENSIVE way.    Think again . . . and think of the WHOLE COUNTY before placing another burden on families who must supply their children with clothing, school supplies, and dozens of necessities that already carry a 9.1% to 9.4% sales tax.    This aquatic center proposal represents not only a failure of financial acuity, but an affront to residents whose household finances are already beyond manageable.  Let's take one little step in the direction of empathy and compassion -- drop this project and redirect the construction funds to something Jefferson County REALLY needs.  Like affordable housing."

We struggle to make ends meet as it is. Taxes should not be for used for amenities like this. We need adequate housing for our young workers and their families. So many times employers struggle to attract workers because housing is too expensive. A fancy pool does nothing to resolve that issue and may exacerbate the problem by increasing property taxes.

It can’t even afford the ongoing maintenance of a pool facility.      The wealth concentrated in Port Townsend can afford such a luxury.  The residents of the rural county are not affluent but generally cash-strapped, making ends meet.  You need to survey the rural population to see how they feel about this—this survey on a website probably isn’t accessible to the general resident who is too busy getting on with his life.  What we are hearing from friends and neighbors is resoundingly NO to the pool.    It’s asking too much of the whole county.  If Port Townsend wants a pool, and they are really the users, they should build a city pool and pay for it with city funds.  We don’t even have basic utilities here—public water, sewer, etc.  A pool is beyond luxury.  We say NO county pool, no increased taxes.  Money should be spent on something more basic like affordable housing."

Im personally not a huge fan of the lazy river idea. It sounds expensive to maintain and would make guarding more difficult. I know having enough guards is a problem at the current pool facility as is. I think a full sized lap pool and a smaller ""family"" pool 3.5 - 5ft deep would serve the community well. Lap swimmers and school practice would not have to share with swim lessons or water aerobics. We have no issue with a higher sales tax to support building a new facility. We are really looking forward to this project getting off the ground. Thank you for providing this survey."

Data shows fewer people swim and that there is a nationwide shortage of lifeguards and aquatic centers across the U.S. have reduced hours because they cannot staff their pools. Public pools can spread disease if not properly maintained and even if they are, are unsanitary and contain urine and bodily fluids. Jefferson County's population is heavily senior. Why not save those funds for another use, and invest a fraction of what you have instead in supporting pickleball courts, the #1 growing sport globally and one seniors seem to love? There is virtually no upkeep, courts are heavily utilized and there will be no controversy or potential problems in relation to public showers, locker rooms as there have been in the past, not to mention slip and fall injuries and lawsuits and so on. No staff is needed (and the related administration and management required to hire, pay and manage them), no cleaning crews. It is an easy sport to learn and people of all ages and abilities are able to play. People bring their own racquets and equipment vs. pools which must purchase and inventory safety equipment and maintain it, as well as other items like paddleboards, floating devices and so on. Please review trends in pickleball usage vs. swimming pool trends and issues. Side note: I do not play pickleball so am not advocating for my own interests. But it seems an obvious choice to support an easy-to-implement system of self-maintaining pickleball courts at a fraction of the cost vs. swimming pools which are costly and are never a good ROI...I think when people hear about having a pool the concept of it seems like a nice thing for a community to have. But digging deeper, it really is a huge cost and maintenance for our rural area that does not make sense. Lastly, there is always the argument that seems to override many of the practical issues, which is it is a safety issue that children must learn to swim. I completely agree it is an important skill for our children. But certainly we could work out some agreement with surrounding communities that already have pools, such as in Sequim, Poulsbo, Bainbridge, etc. to utilize their pools for swimming lessons versus starting from the ground up here and building an entire ""aquatic center.""

A secondary pool for water walking/exercising (or even laps) can be available and kept in the 84 to 86° range.  Port Angeles has done this well, as has Bainbridge. I’m sure you have visited those facilities and spoken with management. If you have not, please do!  (the 79° pool at Bainbridge will be closing February 16 for over a year).  Also imperative is planning ahead for staffing. High schoolers and younger are the future pool staff. MVP used to be staffed by swimmers (girls high school team). Years ago I spoke with Peter, the PTHS girls swim coach, and he told me title IX allows there to be a girls swim team, but there is no boys swim team. Rectifying that must be set in motion now, not only for equity, but for future staffing.  Also consider the unusual step of having a studio apartment or two included in the facility, where a manager could reside. Similar to how HJ Carroll Park has a live-in caretaker. This would resolve some of the “I can’t find anywhere to live“ problem that potential staff face.   The SHORE aquatic center uses a saltwater solution, rather than chlorine. I think that would be welcomed by the people who live in this area.  I highly recommend establishing a culture of ‘everyone must shower before entering the pool.’ This would be unpopular at first, but would greatly benefit community health, water clarity, and longevity of the equipment and facility.  Some may say that they want all the fun things included in an aquatic center (slides, swings, climbing walls). My observation is that large aquatic play areas take up a lot of space yet are rarely used. Perhaps include one or two ‘fun’ things.  Mountain View pool is too hot. 10 years ago it was warm, but swimmable. 86° is unhealthy, bad for the equipment, expensive and polluting. MVP is the only pool I have swum that is not uncomfortable when you first get in. That is not correct. Cold water gets one moving. Moving gets one’s heart rate up. One should not be able to stop and chat for an extended period of time in a lap swimming pool.   I swim in Sequim in a pinch, but have found they are going the way of MVP, with warmer and cloudier pool water. While the Y turned that facility around after it was mismanaged, ideally I would go without the Y, as long as there is good management. Port Angeles and Bainbridge are your best local models for effective community aquatic centers.  Thank you for taking the time to read and for all your efforts in bringing aquatics to East Jefferson County."

I strongly support the idea of indoor gymnasium space with sports courts/ climbing wall/ work-out equipment/ as there are almost no indoor facilities open on weekends for kids/teens/families to be active during rainy winter months. This is a huge part of community wellness and creating space for these makes it much more likely for an entire family to visit the facility (from PT or county or out of county) and ensures there will be something for everyone to do and stay active. I think it would be ideal to think of this as a community wellness center not just an aquatic center. Similar facilities in our region get tons of use and meet the needs of all ages of our population."

Likewise, students would have to be bussed to and from the pool for events and lessons.  The study that used to justify locating in Hadlock was inherently skewed to support a specific conclusion.  If Port Townsend's population is excluded from the 20 minute radius for measurement, how many people are left in the total?  Probably a fraction of the total.  I think the location choice is poor,  but City of PT will probably like getting out from under the current pool subsidy and spreading it over all of East Jefferson county."

I believe there are other places that people can go to get many of the services you list here. There are extensive sport facilities and a rec center in Quilcene. There is a rec center in Chimacum Park (or at least a meeting area). There are numerous sports fields where pickleball courts could be built (Bates, HG Carroll) and there are pickleball courts at the Courthouse. Will a climbing wall benefit retired folks? Won't ownership by an org other than Parks and Rec confuse things? The bottom line - I will support an aquatic center for swimming.

Port Townsend is far wealthier than the rest of the county, if they want a pool, fine, they should pay for it.  If we are building a pool for all of us, then put it in a location for all of us.  Also, stop trying to Port Townsend-up this pool with a zillion extras.  Just build a solid, basic pool.  This Port Townsend non-grounded in reality thinking led to Cherry St debacle, Fort Worden debacle.  Inability to maintain basic roads and utilities in Port Townsend, etc.  Based on this survey I see a lot of the same non-realistic Port Townsend thinking going into this pool.

The demand will grow exponentially over time. We use Shore pool in Port Angeles which is a fabulous lap/ swimmers/ activities pool and it can get easily overcrowded. The pool becomes such a center of community for those who live in Port Angeles, west end, and Sequim. Such a healthy outlet for the young folks as well. The pool operates in the black $$ and they are able to keep it affordable. Conversely, the YMCA in Sequim is expensive and caters more to older folks who are not lap swimmers. Lots of water aerobics and group activities that take over the lap lanes limiting lap swim. So important to have a separate activities pool / area so that the lap lanes are available all day. The pool and sauna are such important therapy spots for veterans who suffer from an assortment of mental health and physical health issues. I am one of those veterans and fully understand the benefits. Make sure the sauna is large enough. The Shore pool sauna is shoulder to shoulder in the evenings when folks are off of work. The sauna gets busy in the mornings as well after early morning lap swim and the aerobics sessions are finished.Spend some time and talk with Steve, the board president, or Mike, the daily pool maintenance guy about what improvements they would make. Think big and think of the future growth of our community and its future needs. The people will definitely come to use the facility especially once they experience its benefits and view it as one of the centers of community. Thanks, Tim Walls, Sequim."

We have been promised a daycare for years and our head start is at risk of closing but neither there is not enough staff to keep a pool in PT open consistently and the daycare can’t open for the city because there’s no director. The last time I completed a comprehensive survey for the pool myself and other families showed up en masse to complete it. When the aggregate results were shown our feedback for family recreation was obvious. But the proposed architectural plans included almost nothing for kids. No lazy river, no climbing wall, no splash pad. I also think that a European model of a coffee shop with a walk in pool would be best. Parents can sit and have a drink and snack for kids and watch them from the table at the edge of the pool. It’s also important to have a sound barrier between types of pool activities and lessons."

Port Ludlow has 3 pools so including their population in the number of people within a 15/20 minute radius inflates the actual usage. There is a small part of the radius number than is just as close to Sequim so take them out of the equation too. The increase in carbon emissions needs to be considered too. I get why people live ""out in the county"" for bigger lots, less expensive (sometimes) housing, and closer to Kitsap/Seattle/Sequim. I used to live ""out in the county"" and had a nicer house with a better view but purposefully chose to live closer to schools and services.  I won't be a jerk and put up ""No Pool for County"" signs and I understand the County has full control of the situation now. If it winds up in Hadlock, do not blow it. Build two tanks MINIMUM. Don't cheap out. Build a Bainbridge or Wm Shore-like pool. Don't copy Sequim or NK. A single pool would be a terrible idea."

It's vastly more expensive now and the hospital is no longer part of the stakeholders, so I'm quite sad at the lost opportunities because of the local government. Sigh.

It is unfortunate that a building that is only 60 years old finds itself in that position; I have visited much larger aquatic facilities in Europe that are hundreds of years old.  Having a basic understanding of the costs of upgrading the mechanical systems at the current pool vs. breaking ground on an entirely new facility, I would prefer to see the current building upgraded.  I understand this would not provide the same level of accessibility and functionality that a new building would, but I do not believe it is worth the additional cost for the benefit of a small section of the population.  I had similar reservations about the new Salish Coast Elementary.  We are a small, rural county with a limited tax base outside the Port Townsend city limits. We do not have the revenue of our neighbors in Clallam county.  Our considerably higher-than-average per-capita tax burden is already not enough to maintain basic services such as sewer, roads and existing parks.  How will the new facility be maintained, when we are not able to maintain the facilities we already have? What will happen to the current pool? How much will it cost to repurpose that space in addition to building and maintaining an entirely new facility?  What about future pressures on our county's resources due to climate change? I strongly suggest we do everything possible to upgrade our current pool."

Not because a tit-for-tat response isn't justified, but because PT residents believe in public funding for public facilities that benefit our residents.  I am disappointed with how the County Commissioners have handled this project.  Pools are hard to operate and pay for.  I think the location is risky for operational reasons.  It will be interesting to see if city residents will be willing to travel to Port Hadlock to use the facilities.  If this facility were located in the City I think it would have more usage and would be more likely to be financially successful.  How this has been handled has only increased city vs. out of city resident tensions.  It could have been handled better.  I wish you luck."

If a new pool had been there I would have supported it whole heart.  The community surrounding the Library and the School is a great place.. With the land inquiry and the Elementary School approval _ and the update on the local systems,  I cannot think of a better plan playing out ! That said, if it happens, remember the k.i.s.s. rule. Make it sweet but not over complicated.   6--8 lane 25* pool, spa for cool down.  Make it for real people - there's a high school down the road and little kids who don't want to learn to swim in icy salt water like i did . Make it slightly bigger than needed at first for periodic growth. You could consider a side pool ( dive pool) that would be worthy of a dive board, and auxiliary stuff like any kind of training.   It would be excellent though -- Look at the layout at Hazen in Renton.  Full pool with a deep water side spot.  Just my $02.  I Care about this.  You will hear my voice again.  Good stuff!"

I know that Sequim had a lot of hard lessons to learn. I think they started offering memberships that you could renew at the same rate that you started the membership. They did not increase the amount paid for family with each passing year, so the early birds were able to cruise by, then the facility became financially unstable. I think the important thing is the swimming pool. Other activities may be encouraged to occur in other venues, like the Chimacum School complex. Be sure there's enough parking, too. My husband used to be a long distance swimmer but due to shoulder issues has had to stop. I also think it's very important to children that they learn how to swim at an early age.

I know it is old fashioned but I think and feel that it is VERY IMPORTANT to have a CLEAR policy regarding who uses which dressing room before the building is built.   As a woman I vote for dressing rooms for women and girls to be for human eings who were born with the traditional female physical characteristics that we associate with females. And vice versa for the dressing rooms for those with the male physical characterisitcs.  It is unfair especially to women to have to deal with humans who were not female at birth in a dressing room where we - especially the young -are vulnerable.  Let's return to the easier days when female dressing rooms were for those who were born with female genitalia and male dressing rooms were for those born with male genitalia.  I know that people have had surgeries to change their bodies. Maybe there has to be a policy for those people.  Perhaps the pool needs THREE dressing rooms.  I feel that a clear policy needs to be written and BEFORE the pool is built and opens.  I, for one, do not want to read about another kafuffel in the newspaper for months on end.  Let's make it easy for ourselves going forward!  Someones need to Think this through Now and make a policy that we can all live with.  I am rooting for you. Good luck!"

Thank you for your work on this. Politically it is very smart to move the location to Hadlock besides that is where it is most needed. Start small with intelligent planning to expand later. Keep it cheap so operations will be inexpensive.  Make it free to use or crazy cheap like a dime a day.   First build an outdoor un/ minimally heated pool. Make it really big with lots of space and lots of lanes. And open 24/7. If I can't find a time I can swim in a lane alone then the pool doesn’t make sense and no one will use it. And don’t forget the kids. Zero entry is awesome for babies and toddlers. Slides are fun for kids. Plus lots of 3 ish foot deep areas for playing. It should have free public showers for the truly homeless. Aka family changing rooms. Aka no more national news. Once that is up and running and everyone sees how great it is then expand into a full blown YMCA thing. Moses lake has a good example of an outdoor pool.   A sales tax is a bad way to fund it. They are regressive. Plus, The business folks will feel attacked and they will crush the effort.   Go for a Levy. Or a recreation district. Then you’ll see the true community support. I think it’s there. (Despite the rapid appearance of all those signs)."

Shore Memorial pool in Port Angeles uses bromine and salt so I can do extended lap swims there.  Extended lap swims are the only way left to me to do aerobic exercise, and therefore having access to unchlorinated water to swim in is a top priority for quality and length of my life!      An outdoor pool is ideal for me, as then I can breathe freely while lap swimming.  Lacking that, an indoor pool sanitized with bromine and salt is the next best option.      I swim in the sound when the temperature and the weather permit, but my body needs aerobic exercise everyday, and due to arthritis of my lower body, I cannot walk long distances, or quickly.      A pool I can swim laps in is essential to me and I can no longer drive to PA 3 times a week as I used to do.      However, a pool is not essential to life, and my husband and I are limited income, low income, fixed income seniors who are trying to hold onto our home in Port Townsend where the cost of everything is rising every day.      I worked as a Registered Nurse all my adult life, caring for disadvantaged children and families, and ANY regressive tax, such as a sales tax rise in these very, very difficult (for many) economic times would be a great burden on us and many others in our position.      As you can see, I desperately need a non-chlorinated pool for maintaining my health, or an outdoor pool where I can breathe non-chlorinated air, or a pool sanitized with chemically benign materials, or a salt water pool .  Also, chlorinated water is known to be toxic for children, as people from PA know.  Teachers at the schools there came to an early PT pool meeting a couple years ago and spoke about this.  That may be why the Shore Center closed for almost a year to rebuild their water sanitation system in order to exclude the use of toxic chlorine.      Please brainstorm funding sources other than regressive sales taxes that punish the poor even more than these tight economic times are doing already.      One idea I had recently is a sliding scale property tax that could begin on properties assessed at, say, $500,000 and go up from there, exempting all those whose property is assessed at less than $500,000.  Those  owning property assessed below $500,000 would be excluded from needing to pay any tax.      For those of us in difficult financial positions, any raise in our taxes for essential items like gasoline or all the other sales tax items means we need to eliminate buying more and more of those essential things.  It is unjust, and unfair.  Especially when there is so much money in property in this county.         We hope and pray you will come up with a way to finance this wonderful pool -- without all the extras -- and NOT on the backs of the poor!   Thank you for listening."

Though a Hadlock facility would be more centrally located for county residents, the proposed site is a more difficult to access than if it were in Port Townsend.. This is because both the larger population base as well as workforce core is in Port Townsend. A much greater number of people on the road to make the trip down the highway will increase congestion and crashes, as well as deter many people, including myself and my wife who are avid swimmers, from using the facility. For those people who would walk or bicycle to the facility, they would also choose not to travel or cannot. Included in this group are children who would go to the facility on their own by bike or walk, but are unable to drive. Please reconsider this wrong headed decision that seems fair, but would be detrimental to the viability of the facility as well as fairness to the vast majority of users. Let’s be honest and admit that much of this decision was driven by a loud campaign of county residents whose motives are not in the best interest of a thriving community."

If they can afford to put green astro turf on crossways then that money could be put towards the pool. Even though I live out in the county I would rather have something for seniors like myself to do. There's nothing out here at all and Port Townsend is starting to grow and we need to have something out here in Hadlock why should everybody be forced to go into port townsend? And maybe if you took away some of the money that the mayor gets since the mirror is getting paid that of the governor maybe that would help get you the pool that you desire.       Also there aren't enough programs for seniors and I'm not going to go to a pool where there's a bunch of kids playing and screaming and yelling I want to have quiet time if I go to a public pool and also I would like to have some senior time I don't feel like I should just have to go at 6:00 in the morning because that's the only time that they have it I don't think that's right. and you say you want to have these other classes I would be open to that but they're expensive and I'm not going to pay high money just to go there three times a month for $200. I would love to do Zumba and pilates and yoga but they're expensive.  So if the county wants to have a pool out in the county for Hadlock quilt scene Brennan then have it out in the county and with the new pool well I'm sure there's some money there just to keep it up to date. A public pool should be accessible to everyone not just a few but, you want people to pay taxes for it and they're not going to so that means they want to raise the house taxes well right now I am a senior living in a rented house and that could lose me my housing because the owners won't pay that they will sell the house so that's a big problem."

If low income south county residents have to pay  more with the current state of the meager rapidly disintegrating social infrastructure, I say no.   I think of those who own second and third houses and Airbnbs. They don’t live full time or spend much money here while contributing to a housing crisis.  There should be a cost to this harm being done to the fabric of our communities.  With a sales tax increase, these well-to-do non-residents are not going to be contributing much of anything.  And what about the private entities like Rayonier who have been exploiting these lands and poisoning our communities for decades.  The wealth built and held in real estate here is vast.  Rayonier and Crown paper should be footing the bill for this kind of project but they aren’t going to be contributing at all with this tax.    A solution would be a progressive tax on people who own property that is valued above a million dollars. They are much less likely to be impacted by hundreds of extra dollars annually.  Whereas a family whose income is $40,000 and pays half of that for rent does not have a couple hundred dollars to spare. It is just directly adding to their poverty and debt.   Poor people are always the easiest to pull from as they have the least voice. Poor people are not the ones pushing for this pool, though many of us could use the services it would provide.   I think low income South County residents could come up with a long list of things they feel their taxation should afford their towns.  It would likely prioritize creating conditions that lead to safe and functional communities like sidewalks, crosswalks, a pharmacy, basic waste water infrastructure, affordable gas and groceries.    We want assurances that our towns and much loved places will be protected from the profiteers building luxury get aways while displacing us and our neighbors who have lived here for generations.  We don’t have that in Quilcene and Brinnon but we are paying the county more and more.   Personally I want to see this pool for my child but our family currently has very little free time and money for extra trips north to pay for enriching stuff.  And it won’t be much use for us in a future where we get priced out and have nowhere to live.  It is important to understand that at the moment the workers in the stores and laborers in the factories and trades are often working full time (or more) and many are not able to meet their basic needs for shelter, food, water, waste management and electricity.  As it stands the pool will be funded by regressive tax and then it will still cost money to use the facilities.  Wouldn’t it make sense to provide free access to low income folks?  These sorts of projects could be a great opportunity to try some new approaches to counteract the regressive WA tax structure that has contributed to the depressing state of our towns.    There are a lot of examples to pull from of projects like this that serve the entire community without further taxing the poor.    Do we have the will to push for the harder thing because it is right or will we stick to the status quo?"

Many are allergic to chlorine in the air and water in high concentration. For our family to use the aquatic center we’d need it to be salt vs heavy chlorine. It is so therapeutic and there is no reason we should be soaking in more toxic chemicals than we already are. Let’s make it clean AND therapeutic. The Mountain View pool made me sick and gave me a full body rash every time! So I had to send my kids to swim lessons in Bainbridge island and shore so that they could learn to swim. Meanwhile paying taxes on maintaining our current pool that was not suitable for us.   I also think community center in connection with the pool and shower facilities is key for our local homeless families or families with difficult living conditions. So many families made trips to PA to shower and bath their kids and to simply warm up in the cold winter months. Sauna, hot tub, showers are all essential in this bone chilling climate for families that are living in busses etc."

It doesn’t make sense that they have the money to do this , but the relative minority - kids and young families , are out voted by them. Because kids annd young families anre struggling to afford properties here.  Our kids need facilities and ways to experience recreation and exercise in a safe environment.

I do have hesitations about the construction techniques I have heard recommended for a new, more affordable pool. I have used the Hood River OR town pool with its sliding roof and special plastic roofing. It is a less than optimal experience.  It can be cold and and windy, it can be steamy and humid. Local lap and exercise swimmers there often find themselves preferring to drive 40 to 60 minutes to other pools along the Gorge. Check it out."

Traffic is already beginning to slow at times. Traffic congestion is not linear. Travel times between PT and Chimicum will quite rapidly increase as traffic volume crosses threshold. Are those concerned with new pool construction considering this factor in future pool use? Seems basic for a pool study. Traffic congestion may not be a concern that the public is aware of until it suddenly happens, though it can be quite straightforwardly anticipated. Traffic forecasts for Highway 19 haven't been done, perhaps because of its low priority compared with the Seattle metro area? Or because it's evident that there would be no budget for adding lanes to the highway, nothing can be done, so why study it? The issue seems to be unacknowledged now in East Jefferson County, so is invisible, though with likely significant future consequences."

No need for a Taj Mahal- type over-the-top facility which costs a lot to build and even more to maintain. This may seem like a retro-grouch request, but we humans are pretty darn adaptable and we really don’t need luxury / extravagance ( I know I know - subjective terms hard to define until we see it) when simple  supportive competence will suffice. I’ll verbally and financially support a new aquatic center if it’s a simple, competent low-maintenance built, with sturdy long-lasting materials.

At my age, 77 years old, it’s the only really good exercise I can do, but no pool would make me either travel a lot OR be totally inactive.  Inactive is not a good choice and traveling to other pools is costly, and unlikely to happen in bad winter weather.  The other thing to consider, is when I travel to other pools, I will be shopping out of county for goods and services while  on a trip to a pool.  Me and my friends have done this when our pool has been closed, thus we are spending money out of our county!
