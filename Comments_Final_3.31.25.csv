I was taught in a community pool at 6 months of age and prioritized teaching my children at a young age (but a little older for ears safety). I would love to see a nice, functional pool happen. I don’t believe in anything state of the art or competition level- it is too much financial burden on the majority of this community. I also believe a pool is extremely beneficial to the vast older population for health purposes or for those recovering from injuries. EDUCATION is key. Please promote swimming programs in the school systems (elementary) and make it accessible for all, not just the financially privileged. In the end, I am fully comfortable swimming in our cold waters 6 months out of the year so I do not need this pool, however I do believe it is optimal for all in our community to have access to one, especially if it can be incorporated into our early education programs.

This aquatic center debacle has made that very clear. And now the majority of the people in the county who will use the pool will have to travel 15+ minutes to use it.

"275","ygk9mh8z","I do not use indoor facilities of anybody kind right now or for foreseeable future. I would very likely use an outdoor pool and/or hot tub. If swimming instruction was available outside I would do that. If water exercise was available outside I would use that.  I am a nonbinary transgender man. I have been mercilessly harassed in shared changing/shower facilities all my life pre transition.  I have avoided pools most of my life due to harassment and I barely learned to swim although I love the water. I have never used single gender or shared shower/changing facilities post transition.  unless there are single stall showers and changing rooms, both with full curtains, that are expressly gender nonspecific (all sex/genders), then I would not be using the showers or changing facilities. That would greatly reduce the likelihood of me ever using the pool. On the other hand, if such facilities were available to me, and the pool itself was outdoors, I would envisage pretty frequent use.   I believe a pool is essential for our community. I would love a facility I felt comfortable using.  But I strongly believe we need one even if I were never to use it.    However I cannot support funding that uses a sales tax. This is a very regressive type of tax that puts too great a burden on people with less economic means. It takes a much higher percentage a poor person’s available funds than it does a richer person’s. It also tends to hit harder on  people who do not have the ability to go out of county to do their shopping. I believe it will also be keenly felt by anyone undertaking a major building project here.  The result will be an even greater tendency to purchase materials out of county, for example at big box building suppliers, and that will not be good for our local businesses.    I would also imagine that the sales tax would be applied to services purchased here? Would there be an added tax for dental work? For window washing and roof cleaning or repair? Again, I believe people will increasingly use out of county providers for services and this will not benefit the community.  Please find a less regressive funding mechanism.   I understand that one of the goals of the facility is for use by the public schools. And indeed the new proposed location is to be near a public school.  It seems to me that if the schools are to be using the facility then the school system should be expected to fund some part of it that is equivalent to the anticipated percent of use.  I used to live right next to a school that had a pool that was open to the public during certain hours. I used it once and then never used it. My experience was that the public hours were very short creating a massive competition for space and time. There were so many faster swimmers who were very impatient with beginners like myself.   in the afternoons the schedule was extremely crowded with school-related events, and open swimming ended up being late in the day. Too late and again too crowded.    I fear that having a pool be literally on site of a school will create these kinds of scheduling pressures. And if it is to be used much of the time or half of the time by the schools, then school funding should contribute to paying for it.  I will also weigh in to say that while I appreciate the challenges of building.a new pool on the site of the old pool, a facility in Chimacum will not provide the same level of access to the aging population inhabiting Port Townsend. My observation is that many elderly users currently walk to the pool, and a number of somewhat younger users bike to it.  t. Your survey does not ask about how people would get to the pool.  A number of us elderly folk in the area mask and rarely use public transport because other riders don’t mask. And a number of us are not really comfortable driving long distances.  Biking in this county outside of the city of PT is like handing your life over to a crazy game of a Russian roulette.  My point is that moving the pool out of the City of PT really changes/reduces access for an aging population that would greatly benefit from pool use and from the ability to walk or bike there.    I do not live in the City of PT but I would be way more likely to use a pool located there than in Chimacum: From my perspective it would be a lot better if the pool were located somewhere closer to halfway between.  However, I am under the impression that that ship has sailed And that the site has  pretty much been selected.  I don’t love it. I’ll use the pool less if at all. But I support the pool."

Aquatic centers always cater most to kids and families, and rarely offer any programs or lap swims at days/times that are attractive to senior citizens. I for one oppose and  resent paying yet even higher taxes for a facility only a fraction of county residents will use. I already pay fees for a pool at Kala Point.

From school-aged children in swim safety programs and swim lessons at an early age to middle and high-schoolers participating in swim clubs and teams, to seniors doing aqua fitness and water walking, our community has a responsibility to support physical and mental wellness. Further, this facility must be accessible to all, regardless of age, demographics, and socio-economics. This is not the time to build an upscale facility that mimics a private club."

If the Y were built at Port Hadlock we estimate that the forecast would have to be reduced by about 50% of the forecasts shown in the report.""   2) The non-aquatic amenities being considered do not include some of the largest revenue producing one such as exercise and weight equipment. Self-sustaining aquatic recreation centers (such as the Sequim Y) need these to be financially sustainable (not including debt servicing).  This means that the PFD funds will be needed for operational funds and thereby this reduces the PFD resources that can be used to service debt."

As mentioned, I am new to the area from out of state and truly upset and disappointed that Jefferson County has fought the new resort development so hard in Brinnon. So do you think that Brinnon does not deserve it? One thought is...why would JFCO not want those additional tax dollars that could help Brinnon thrive and become an area similar to Port Ludlow? This town has so much potential and if that were approved, this small town might actually become a highlight to the county instead of being a thorn in JEFCOs xxxx!   I am at the point I would like to sell and I am one of the most expensive home in my neighborhood and because of all the actions recently, I would never be able to recoup the outrageous price I paid for my home.

Please do the research in a responsible way!  Is there ANY municipality (city or county) that has been able to support construction and ongoing maintenance of a pool or an aquatic facility with fewer than 35,000 residents?    As we know, grants are less and less reliable, and need to be understood as ""one time revenue"".  Continuous revenue like a sales tax paid by fewer than 16,000 households will never be sufficient to cover the perpetual cost of an aquatic facility - no matter how much in user fee income can be collected from those who say they are likely users.    Swimming and water exercise are not the only way to achieve individual rehabilitation and wellness goals, although they are arguably THE MOST EXPENSIVE way.    Think again . . . and think of the WHOLE COUNTY before placing another burden on families who must supply their children with clothing, school supplies, and dozens of necessities that already carry a 9.1% to 9.4% sales tax.    This aquatic center proposal represents not only a failure of financial acuity, but an affront to residents whose household finances are already beyond manageable.

Data shows fewer people swim and that there is a nationwide shortage of lifeguards and aquatic centers across the U.S. have reduced hours because they cannot staff their pools. Public pools can spread disease if not properly maintained and even if they are, are unsanitary and contain urine and bodily fluids. Jefferson County's population is heavily senior. Why not save those funds for another use, and invest a fraction of what you have instead in supporting pickleball courts, the #1 growing sport globally and one seniors seem to love? There is virtually no upkeep, courts are heavily utilized and there will be no controversy or potential problems in relation to public showers, locker rooms as there have been in the past, not to mention slip and fall injuries and lawsuits and so on. No staff is needed (and the related administration and management required to hire, pay and manage them), no cleaning crews. It is an easy sport to learn and people of all ages and abilities are able to play. People bring their own racquets and equipment vs. pools which must purchase and inventory safety equipment and maintain it, as well as other items like paddleboards, floating devices and so on. Please review trends in pickleball usage vs. swimming pool trends and issues. Side note: I do not play pickleball so am not advocating for my own interests. But it seems an obvious choice to support an easy-to-implement system of self-maintaining pickleball courts at a fraction of the cost vs. swimming pools which are costly and are never a good ROI...I think when people hear about having a pool the concept of it seems like a nice thing for a community to have. But digging deeper, it really is a huge cost and maintenance for our rural area that does not make sense. Lastly, there is always the argument that seems to override many of the practical issues, which is it is a safety issue that children must learn to swim. I completely agree it is an important skill for our children. But certainly we could work out some agreement with surrounding communities that already have pools, such as in Sequim, Poulsbo, Bainbridge, etc. to utilize their pools for swimming lessons versus starting from the ground up here and building an entire ""aquatic center.""

"1130","TQCKtgZV","It is imperative that the focus of an aquatic center be a competitive 25 yard lap swimming pool with blocks and cool, clear water, around 79°F. A secondary pool for water walking/exercising (or even laps) can be available and kept in the 84 to 86° range.  Port Angeles has done this well, as has Bainbridge. I’m sure you have visited those facilities and spoken with management. If you have not, please do!  (the 79° pool at Bainbridge will be closing February 16 for over a year).  Also imperative is planning ahead for staffing. High schoolers and younger are the future pool staff. MVP used to be staffed by swimmers (girls high school team). Years ago I spoke with Peter, the PTHS girls swim coach, and he told me title IX allows there to be a girls swim team, but there is no boys swim team. Rectifying that must be set in motion now, not only for equity, but for future staffing.  Also consider the unusual step of having a studio apartment or two included in the facility, where a manager could reside. Similar to how HJ Carroll Park has a live-in caretaker. This would resolve some of the “I can’t find anywhere to live“ problem that potential staff face.   The SHORE aquatic center uses a saltwater solution, rather than chlorine. I think that would be welcomed by the people who live in this area.  I highly recommend establishing a culture of ‘everyone must shower before entering the pool.’ This would be unpopular at first, but would greatly benefit community health, water clarity, and longevity of the equipment and facility.  Some may say that they want all the fun things included in an aquatic center (slides, swings, climbing walls). My observation is that large aquatic play areas take up a lot of space yet are rarely used. Perhaps include one or two ‘fun’ things.  Mountain View pool is too hot. 10 years ago it was warm, but swimmable. 86° is unhealthy, bad for the equipment, expensive and polluting. MVP is the only pool I have swum that is not uncomfortable when you first get in. That is not correct. Cold water gets one moving. Moving gets one’s heart rate up. One should not be able to stop and chat for an extended period of time in a lap swimming pool.   I swim in Sequim in a pinch, but have found they are going the way of MVP, with warmer and cloudier pool water. While the Y turned that facility around after it was mismanaged, ideally I would go without the Y, as long as there is good management.

The pool operates in the black $$ and they are able to keep it affordable. Conversely, the YMCA in Sequim is expensive and caters more to older folks who are not lap swimmers. Lots of water aerobics and group activities that take over the lap lanes limiting lap swim. So important to have a separate activities pool / area so that the lap lanes are available all day. The pool and sauna are such important therapy spots for veterans who suffer from an assortment of mental health and physical health issues. I am one of those veterans and fully understand the benefits. Make sure the sauna is large enough. The Shore pool sauna is shoulder to shoulder in the evenings when folks are off of work. The sauna gets busy in the mornings as well after early morning lap swim and the aerobics sessions are finished.Spend some time and talk with Steve, the board president, or Mike, the daily pool maintenance guy about what improvements they would make. Think big and think of the future growth of our community and its future needs.

People purposefully come to PT for services, schools (including from CSD), jobs and more. Far fewer people go to Hadlock for such purposes. More kids do not live ""out in the county"" as I hear some saying. CSD is very small compared to PTSD. Port Ludlow has 3 pools so including their population in the number of people within a 15/20 minute radius inflates the actual usage. There is a small part of the radius number than is just as close to Sequim so take them out of the equation too. The increase in carbon emissions needs to be considered too. I get why people live ""out in the county"" for bigger lots, less expensive (sometimes) housing, and closer to Kitsap/Seattle/Sequim. I used to live ""out in the county"" and had a nicer house with a better view but purposefully chose to live closer to schools and services.  I won't be a jerk and put up ""No Pool for County"" signs and I understand the County has full control of the situation now. If it winds up in Hadlock, do not blow it. Build two tanks MINIMUM.

It is unfortunate that a building that is only 60 years old finds itself in that position; I have visited much larger aquatic facilities in Europe that are hundreds of years old.  Having a basic understanding of the costs of upgrading the mechanical systems at the current pool vs. breaking ground on an entirely new facility, I would prefer to see the current building upgraded.  I understand this would not provide the same level of accessibility and functionality that a new building would, but I do not believe it is worth the additional cost for the benefit of a small section of the population.  I had similar reservations about the new Salish Coast Elementary.  We are a small, rural county with a limited tax base outside the Port Townsend city limits. We do not have the revenue of our neighbors in Clallam county.  Our considerably higher-than-average per-capita tax burden is already not enough to maintain basic services such as sewer, roads and existing parks.  How will the new facility be maintained, when we are not able to maintain the facilities we already have? What will happen to the current pool?

And vice versa for the dressing rooms for those with the male physical characterisitcs.  It is unfair especially to women to have to deal with humans who were not female at birth in a dressing room where we - especially the young -are vulnerable.  Let's return to the easier days when female dressing rooms were for those who were born with female genitalia and male dressing rooms were for those born with male genitalia.  I know that people have had surgeries to change their bodies. Maybe there has to be a policy for those people.  Perhaps the pool needs THREE dressing rooms.

Start small with intelligent planning to expand later. Keep it cheap so operations will be inexpensive.  Make it free to use or crazy cheap like a dime a day.   First build an outdoor un/ minimally heated pool. Make it really big with lots of space and lots of lanes. And open 24/7. If I can't find a time I can swim in a lane alone then the pool doesn’t make sense and no one will use it. And don’t forget the kids. Zero entry is awesome for babies and toddlers. Slides are fun for kids. Plus lots of 3 ish foot deep areas for playing. It should have free public showers for the truly homeless. Aka family changing rooms. Aka no more national news. Once that is up and running and everyone sees how great it is then expand into a full blown YMCA thing. Moses lake has a good example of an outdoor pool.   A sales tax is a bad way to fund it.

"2165","wkCKmHiC","Being highly allergic to breathing chlorine, I cannot swim in indoor pools that use it.  Shore Memorial pool in Port Angeles uses bromine and salt so I can do extended lap swims there.  Extended lap swims are the only way left to me to do aerobic exercise, and therefore having access to unchlorinated water to swim in is a top priority for quality and length of my life!      An outdoor pool is ideal for me, as then I can breathe freely while lap swimming.  Lacking that, an indoor pool sanitized with bromine and salt is the next best option.      I swim in the sound when the temperature and the weather permit, but my body needs aerobic exercise everyday, and due to arthritis of my lower body, I cannot walk long distances, or quickly.      A pool I can swim laps in is essential to me and I can no longer drive to PA 3 times a week as I used to do.      However, a pool is not essential to life, and my husband and I are limited income, low income, fixed income seniors who are trying to hold onto our home in Port Townsend where the cost of everything is rising every day.      I worked as a Registered Nurse all my adult life, caring for disadvantaged children and families, and ANY regressive tax, such as a sales tax rise in these very, very difficult (for many) economic times would be a great burden on us and many others in our position.      As you can see, I desperately need a non-chlorinated pool for maintaining my health, or an outdoor pool where I can breathe non-chlorinated air, or a pool sanitized with chemically benign materials, or a salt water pool .  Also, chlorinated water is known to be toxic for children, as people from PA know.  Teachers at the schools there came to an early PT pool meeting a couple years ago and spoke about this.  That may be why the Shore Center closed for almost a year to rebuild their water sanitation system in order to exclude the use of toxic chlorine.      Please brainstorm funding sources other than regressive sales taxes that punish the poor even more than these tight economic times are doing already.      One idea I had recently is a sliding scale property tax that could begin on properties assessed at, say, $500,000 and go up from there, exempting all those whose property is assessed at less than $500,000.  Those  owning property assessed below $500,000 would be excluded from needing to pay any tax.      For those of us in difficult financial positions, any raise in our taxes for essential items like gasoline or all the other sales tax items means we need to eliminate buying more and more of those essential things.  It is unjust, and unfair.  Especially when there is so much money in property in this county.         We hope and pray you will come up with a way to finance this wonderful pool -- without all the extras -- and NOT on the backs of the poor!   Thank you for listening."

Though a Hadlock facility would be more centrally located for county residents, the proposed site is a more difficult to access than if it were in Port Townsend.. This is because both the larger population base as well as workforce core is in Port Townsend. A much greater number of people on the road to make the trip down the highway will increase congestion and crashes, as well as deter many people, including myself and my wife who are avid swimmers, from using the facility. For those people who would walk or bicycle to the facility, they would also choose not to travel or cannot.

Please reconsider this wrong headed decision that seems fair, but would be detrimental to the viability of the facility as well as fairness to the vast majority of users.

Also there aren't enough programs for seniors and I'm not going to go to a pool where there's a bunch of kids playing and screaming and yelling I want to have quiet time if I go to a public pool and also I would like to have some senior time I don't feel like I should just have to go at 6:00 in the morning because that's the only time that they have it I don't think that's right. and you say you want to have these other classes I would be open to that but they're expensive and I'm not going to pay high money just to go there three times a month for $200.

In  these times of our uncertain economy, many folks do not need more  taxation."
"2268","9qCik6MS","I support all of this and more only if paid through a progressive tax model.  If low income south county residents have to pay  more with the current state of the meager rapidly disintegrating social infrastructure, I say no.   I think of those who own second and third houses and Airbnbs. They don’t live full time or spend much money here while contributing to a housing crisis.  There should be a cost to this harm being done to the fabric of our communities.  With a sales tax increase, these well-to-do non-residents are not going to be contributing much of anything.  And what about the private entities like Rayonier who have been exploiting these lands and poisoning our communities for decades.  The wealth built and held in real estate here is vast.  Rayonier and Crown paper should be footing the bill for this kind of project but they aren’t going to be contributing at all with this tax.    A solution would be a progressive tax on people who own property that is valued above a million dollars. They are much less likely to be impacted by hundreds of extra dollars annually.  Whereas a family whose income is $40,000 and pays half of that for rent does not have a couple hundred dollars to spare. It is just directly adding to their poverty and debt.   Poor people are always the easiest to pull from as they have the least voice. Poor people are not the ones pushing for this pool, though many of us could use the services it would provide.   I think low income South County residents could come up with a long list of things they feel their taxation should afford their towns.  It would likely prioritize creating conditions that lead to safe and functional communities like sidewalks, crosswalks, a pharmacy, basic waste water infrastructure, affordable gas and groceries.    We want assurances that our towns and much loved places will be protected from the profiteers building luxury get aways while displacing us and our neighbors who have lived here for generations.  We don’t have that in Quilcene and Brinnon but we are paying the county more and more.   Personally I want to see this pool for my child but our family currently has very little free time and money for extra trips north to pay for enriching stuff.  And it won’t be much use for us in a future where we get priced out and have nowhere to live.  It is important to understand that at the moment the workers in the stores and laborers in the factories and trades are often working full time (or more) and many are not able to meet their basic needs for shelter, food, water, waste management and electricity.  As it stands the pool will be funded by regressive tax and then it will still cost money to use the facilities.  Wouldn’t it make sense to provide free access to low income folks?  These sorts of projects could be a great opportunity to try some new approaches to counteract the regressive WA tax structure that has contributed to the depressing state of our towns.    There are a lot of examples to pull from of projects like this that serve the entire community without further taxing the poor.    Do we have the will to push for the harder thing because it is right or will we stick to the status quo?"

Let’s make it clean AND therapeutic. The Mountain View pool made me sick and gave me a full body rash every time! So I had to send my kids to swim lessons in Bainbridge island and shore so that they could learn to swim. Meanwhile paying taxes on maintaining our current pool that was not suitable for us.   I also think community center in connection with the pool and shower facilities is key for our local homeless families or families with difficult living conditions.

A simple building with a pool, gendered bathrooms, changing facilities and showers, spa and sauna, adequate parking, very close proximity to frequent transportation, and that’s it. No need for a Taj Mahal- type over-the-top facility which costs a lot to build and even more to maintain.

It all started with the community swim lessons for babies, I had my first swim class as a 1 year old, where the babies are trained to flip on their back. Growing up with this confident swimming foundation really sets the stage for kids to make healthy choices. I don't have kids but I would love nothing more than to have an option for the current and future generations to get that head start. We learn how to swim in pools in the PNW, I can't say I've seen a baby swim class in the ocean up here, even in the summer.

There are far and few housing resources, people are struggling daily with the cost of food or gas, we have so little access to dental available that takes a Medicaid or access to mental health resources. I really appreciate the efforts to add to the community but you are missing the big picture if you truly care about the people (and want more young families here)."

Jefferson County doesn’t have the funds to fix or clean the garbage off of our roads or update our ancient infrastructure. Jefferson County is absolutely full poor citizens , it is not full of the rich! When WE can HOUSE, FEED take care of OUR CHILDREN AND OUR POOR then maybe the privileged rich citizens can have their pool. How about the privileged few, living in their wealthy bubbles, pay for this waste of time and public money and fund the building of their pool themselves, not pick the pockets of their own community. Shame on you."

I would be over the moon if there was a public gym closer to Quilcene, and having a space that young people can have lessons would be amazing!  Projects like this make me really excited and i know an aquatics center would be well utilized by community members, myself included"

People living out of that area, in my case Brinnon which is over 60 miles round trip (>$15 in todays gas prices for just one trip) are being asked to fund a pool that is almost a 2 hour round trip drive. Why should we pay for a pool that has no benefit to us. Let the communities that would benefit pay for it."

Add a café, rock climbing, various other sports and it would serve everyone in the community well.
